Observations and data from rock deformation are essential to a wide range of research in geoengineering, geologic hazards, geophysics, and planetary geology. However, most institutions do not have active research programs in rock deformation, due to the scale, cost, and technical needs of an experimental rock deformation lab. The Research Opportunities in Rock Deformation (RORD) REU site provides training in experimental rock deformation and generates a robust pipeline of students and industry professionals from all backgrounds. <br/><br/>The RORD REU site provides research and mentorship opportunities for undergraduate students in the field of experimental rock deformation. The long-term objective is to expand the pipeline of students pursuing research or industry careers in rock deformation or related fields. Student participants receive training in research methods and professional development topics that provide a stable foundation for graduate school or related career paths. A large team of PIs and senior participants, composed of academic researchers in rock deformation, ensures that students who participate in the program have a deep professional network to support their future endeavors. Students are drawn from the full spectrum of higher education institutions. Strong emphases are placed on recruiting students from smaller colleges and universities that do not have research programs in rock deformation. The REU site includes three integrated sessions: a field session to introduce students to the geological study of deformed rocks, a laboratory session where students conduct experiments on specimens collected during the field session, and a conference session where students have the opportunity to present the results of their research projects. The REU site uses an innovated distributed model, leveraging the combined lab capacity of the PIs and other senior participants to support 10 students per year.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2529421,Collaborative Research: Harnessing beaver-based restoration to conserve freshwater biodiversity across environmental gradients,DEB,Conservation Science&Practice,01/01/2026,08/27/2025,Emily Fairfax,MN,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Standard Grant,Colette St. Mary,12/31/2030,"$251,815.00",,efairfax@umn.edu,2221 UNIVERSITY AVE SE STE 100,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,554143074,6126245599,BIO,347Y00,,$0.00,"Streams and associated riparian areas supply water for a multitude of downstream uses, reduce wildfire risk, and provide habitat for many species. Streams are increasingly threatened by drought, flood, and changing patterns of land and water use. Accordingly, billions of dollars have been spent to restore these ecosystems so that they can continue to provide vital services for people and support valuable fish and wildlife resources. Stream restoration increasingly focuses on beavers, which were once common throughout North America but were harvested nearly to extinction in the 18th and 19th centuries. Beaver-based restoration, which includes reintroducing beaver to historically occupied habitat and building structures that mimic beaver dams, has the potential for far-reaching beneficial impacts on stream and riparian ecosystems. However, it is not clear how these benefits vary across different environments and with different restoration practices. This proposal will provide critical data on how beaver-based restoration  improves stream and riparian health. Such information is critical for promoting responsible use of restoration funding and effective stewardship of natural resources in a changing environment. <br/><br/>This proposal will investigate the effects of beaver-based restoration on stream and riparian habitats and associated fish and wildlife species across divergent precipitation regimes using a large-scale, five-year field experiment and a complementary set of artificial stream experiments. Specifically, investigators will evaluate: 1) the effects of beaver reintroduction and the construction of beaver dam analogs on fish, amphibians, birds, bats, and mammals in wet vs. dry climates, 2) the specific mechanisms underlying the effects of beaver-based restoration on key habitat features under different streamflow conditions, and 3) the efficacy of different beaver-based restoration practices for achieving specific habitat and biodiversity outcomes. The field experiment will feature four types of sites: 1) beaver reintroduction (the translocation of beavers into currently unoccupied sites), 2) beaver-mimicry (the construction of beaver dam analogs), 3) unrestored controls, and 4) beaver-occupied reference sites. These site types will be replicated on the wet west side and the drier east side of the Cascades Range in the Pacific Northwest. The artificial stream experiments will provide detailed mechanistic insight into how different types of beaver-related structures, and different spatial layouts of such structures, influence stream and riparian habitat variables under varying streamflow conditions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems through the Partnership to Advance Conservation Science and Practice Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These problems slow the reactions of bacteria and make energy harvesting inefficient. This project will create tiny particles that combine solar-powered electronics with bacterial activity to accelerate these important biological reactions. Each particle is designed to provide a surface at a voltage where certain microbes can best do what they are expert at: breaking down organic compounds. The bacteria enriched on these surfaces have a unique ability; their internal metabolism is connected to their outer surface. A metal electrode on the particle can collect electrical current from these bacteria and send it to a photovoltaic cell. The additional power drives hydrogen gas production from a second electrode, which can be collected or further converted into methane. These particles can flow freely through water, allowing them to access fresh nutrients and avoid many limitations of traditional systems. The silicon and glass-based particles are non-toxic, largely using materials common in sand and soil or using other materials, such as tiny aluminum or gold electrodes, that do not harm the surrounding environment. This technology opens new possibilities for wastewater treatment, energy production, and environmental monitoring. Our research supports a collaboration between students and scientists in microbiology and electrical engineering, offering unique training and educational opportunities.<br/>The discovery of electroactive microorganisms enabled a new generation of biological systems integrated with electronic devices. When microorganisms can transfer electrons directly to or from electrodes, new kinds of wastewater treatment, soil bioremediation, biofuel synthesis, biomaterial production, and biosensing are possible. However, all microbial electrochemical technologies are constrained by diffusional limitations and inefficiencies, especially in water with low buffering capacity. This project addresses these challenges through a novel approach: self-powered, mobile microparticles that integrate anodes, photodiodes, and cathodes. These devices, having electrodes smaller than a typical diffusion length, harness spherical diffusion dynamics to enhance reaction rates while the photodiodes bias electrodes to voltages favorable to microbial metabolism, simplifying operation and reducing resistance losses. In addition, the particles themselves are small enough to be carried by fluid flow, which allows them to constantly travel through new regions of solutions where nutrients are available. Our interdisciplinary effort bridges microbiology and electrical engineering to fabricate and systematically test these devices. This completely new platform for growing electroactive microorganisms free of diffusional limitations and external power sources has the potential for transformative advances in catalytic rates and increased throughput of microbial experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, conventional electronic-based computing systems face a critical bottleneck: the energy and time required to move data between processors and memory now exceed the costs of performing the calculations themselves. This imbalance has slowed progress in AI and deep learning, while contributing to rising energy demands. This project explores a transformative computing paradigm grounded in photonic-based, in contrast to the conventional electronic-based paradigm, enabling information processing through light. Using diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs), our team will develop specialized, ultrathin computing systems composed of engineered nanostructures that manipulate light waves. These DONN-based systems are capable of performing inference tasks at the speed of light while consuming significantly less energy than conventional electronic platforms. These breakthroughs will support future embedded and edge devices, from smart sensors to autonomous systems, enabling AI to scale sustainably. The project will expand the American workforce in AI and optical computing by integrating education and outreach. The PIs will connect students from local community colleges to research opportunities and build upon successful undergraduate and K-12 outreach programs at both NC State and the University of Minnesota. The team will introduce new AI- and photonics-focused courses into the undergraduate curriculum and engage students through REU programs, design projects, and public-facing events such as youth AI labs, science competitions, and museum activities. Together, these efforts will prepare students with expertise in optics, nanofabrication, and machine learning, ensuring they are equipped to lead future innovations in photonic computing.<br/><br/>This project seeks to design, fabricate, and experimentally validate a new generation of metasurface-based diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) that overcome key limitations of existing optical accelerators. The research targets three major advances: (1) Multi-modality: developing a unified DONN framework capable of processing diverse data types, including images, text, and graphs, and integrating programmable metasurface layers to significantly broaden its application scope. (2) Scalability: enabling deep, large-scale network inference using iterative train-prune-retrain, weight clustering, and tile-wise sparsification to minimize diffraction errors and optical crosstalk, combined with nonlinear activation reduction techniques such as low-degree polynomial network approximations for efficient, stable inference; and (3) Robustness to physical non-idealities: integrating fabrication-aware optimization and phase smoothing to mitigate meta-atom geometry variations, inter-element crosstalk, and environmental instabilities. The DONNs will employ multi-channel metasurface layers that leverage wavelength and polarization multiplexing for parallel, multi-task processing, and will incorporate architectural strategies such as shared diffractive layers, spatially distinct task routing, and optical skip connections to extend functionality to transformer and graph-style architectures. Fabrication will follow a staged cleanroom-to-foundry pipeline, with TiO2 nanofin metasurfaces prototyped at NC State and scaled through commercial foundry tape-outs to achieve device areas exceeding 250 μm2. The resulting systems will be experimentally benchmarked for accuracy, energy efficiency, and throughput across different workloads. By tightly integrating algorithmic innovation, photonic device engineering, and experimental validation, this work will establish the foundations for compact, energy-efficient, and adaptive optical AI processors, offering a pathway toward practical deployment in embedded and edge-computing applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, predicting when and how these pathogens spill over into domestic animals or humans remains a significant challenge. This is mainly due to limited knowledge about which reservoir hosts interact with potential recipient species, how long those interactions last, and which types of contact are most likely to result in pathogen transmission. Recent advancements in animal biologging and pathogen genetic sequencing are opening new opportunities to map contact networks and trace pathogen transmission across species. This research integrates animal tracking data, pathogen genomics, and mathematical modeling to better understand and predict cross-species transmission dynamics. The project focuses on blood-feeding vampire bats, key wildlife reservoirs for rabies virus, and the livestock upon which they feed. By analyzing interactions between these species, the project aims to identify patterns of contact and transmission that can inform more effective surveillance and control strategies. Given rising concerns over emerging zoonotic pathogens, the research is timely. It not only advances methods to integrate diverse data streams to study spillover but also provides practical insights into managing vampire-bat livestock conflict, an issue of growing concern. The research will also broaden participation by mentoring trainees, strengthening scientific capacity in our study areas, and engaging communities through school programs and public outreach on infectious disease prevention.<br/><br/>This project aims to (1) characterize dynamic, multi-species contact networks between vampire bats and livestock using animal-borne proximity sensors; (2) map pathogen-sharing networks by analyzing genetic similarity among common viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens (e.g., coronaviruses and rabies virus, hemoplasmas, and trypanosomes); and (3) develop statistical and simulation models to identify likely transmission routes, understand epidemiological dynamics, and inform rabies virus control strategies. The outcomes will advance our fundamental understanding of pathogen spread in complex host communities. Additionally, our integrative approach, combining animal tracking with pathogen diagnostics, will offer a valuable framework for studying cross-species transmission in other systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While citizen science - or crowdsourcing science - has been successfully leveraged over the past several decades to close the analysis gap arising from large amounts of data, the sheer scale and complexity of these new data sets presents new challenges. This project addresses these challenges through novel Citizen Science Cyberinfrastructure (CSCI) where new tools and techniques, including teaming humans with Artificial Intelligence (AI), are being developed to enable researchers to efficiently extract the best results from large and complex data sets. This effort incorporates mapping, machine learning, and data sharing innovations in biodiversity, geoscience, and astronomy research and expands the capacity of research communities across a wide range of disciplines to use citizen science as a suitable, open and sustainable research methodology. <br/><br/>This project leverages NSF-supported cyberinfrastructure, including the Zooniverse citizen science platform with its nearly three million volunteers, to provide a novel cyberinfrastructure by: (1) integrating mapping infrastructure into Zooniverse to accelerate accurate processing and curation of often complex data sets for geoscience and biodiversity projects; (2) providing an ""incubator"" hub for researchers and developers to design and deploy innovative citizen science projects with a fast production turn-around particularly for AI training; and (3) providing cyber-pathways to existing cyberinfrastructure, creating documentation for Zooniverse projects to responsibly deposit their data into appropriate repositories, and facilitating workshops for Zooniverse project teams to develop best practices for data and model sharing. To ensure wide dissemination of the new CSCI, a strong Community of Practice is engaged and supported throughout the project effort.

Leveraging recent advances in imaging and machine learning, the system delivers automated, label-free particle analysis with high sensitivity and throughput. While standard quality tests are typically conducted offline and manually, this new technology fills a critical gap by enabling continuous, inline monitoring, supporting the industry’s shift from batch to continuous manufacturing. Real-time monitoring allows earlier identification of contaminants, reducing production downtime, minimizing waste, and improving product safety. Specific broader impacts of the research include strengthening U.S. competitiveness in smart manufacturing and quality assurance through advanced sensor integration and real-time analytics. The project is expected to cut recall and quality control costs by as much as 20%, potentially saving large manufacturers hundreds of millions annually. Its broader applicability spans food safety, environmental monitoring, and biodefense, offering scalable benefits for public health, ecological protection, and national security. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of a real-time, inline sensor system which integrates Digital Inline Holography (DIH) and deep learning for dual-function analysis of particulate matter (PM) and sterility in liquid production environments. Key innovations include high-throughput, label-free imaging; low false-positive detection of viable microbes; and robust PM classification with real-time visualization. DIH employs a low-power laser to illuminate particles in flow, generating interference patterns (holograms) captured by a high-resolution camera. These holograms are reconstructed into three-dimensional optical fields from which particle morphology, phase, and optical characteristics are extracted. A customized deep learning model, trained on those features using a diverse database of PM and biocontaminants, classifies contaminants at the single-particle level. The system also integrates a high-throughput preconcentration module to enhance detection sensitivity, achieving limits below 0.1 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) at throughputs exceeding 1 mL/min. The modular, compact system design enables deployment at multiple stages of production. The deep learning model leverages transfer learning techniques, allowing efficient adaptation to new products and contamination types. This research will address key challenges in deploying optical sensors in industrial settings, including integration with fluid systems for robust, reliable operation under real-world conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One approach has emerged as a promising solution to solve this challenge by enabling models to be trained across many different sources without directly sharing private data. This approach has become particularly valuable in sensitive sectors such as medical diagnostics, where individual data privacy is legally protected. Despite these advancements, existing systems for training models across multiple sources lack standardized assessment tools, posing challenges to research reproducibility, validation, and trust.  Without proper testing tools, organizations cannot verify that their privacy protections work as intended, creating barriers to adoption in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and national security. This project addresses this challenge by developing comprehensive testing tools that ensure privacy-preserving artificial intelligence systems work reliably, serving the national interest by enabling secure collaboration on AI development while protecting individual privacy, supporting American competitiveness in artificial intelligence technologies, and strengthening data security across critical infrastructure.<br/><br/>This project designs, develops, and sustains FLTest, an interdisciplinary testbed that automates privacy and robustness evaluations in federated learning systems, addressing gaps often overlooked by traditional tools. The research activities include developing automated test orchestration frameworks, implementing privacy attack simulation models, creating configuration vulnerability detection systems, and building recommendation engines for optimization. The testbed's key innovation streamlines evaluations through automated orchestration assisted by a pitfall checker that detects configuration issues and vulnerabilities in privacy evaluations. FLTest empowers both novice and expert users with actionable insights tailored to real-world applications. The team will validate FLTest across multiple domains and datasets, develop standardized benchmarks for assessment, and create detailed reporting mechanisms for security analysis. By utilizing distinct datasets and offering a standardized solution, FLTest verifies model privacy and robustness across heterogeneous data distributions, supporting the development of reliable privacy-preserving federated learning systems.

However, touch is still not well studied. The sense of touch allows one to move about, as well as identify, analyze properties of and manipulate objects. Touch complements other senses and is a critical part of a person’s ability to identify fine features, develop spatial awareness, learn, and form memories. Touch enables people to combine information across different senses and to form emotional experiences. However, most digital experiences have yet to include touch. This project will use a novel approach to enable images that combine sight and touch through detailed, dynamic, and rich haptic displays built from recently developed soft materials that significantly respond to changes in their settings. Including rich haptic experiences will transform human-computer interaction, much like the giant leap forward when computers began presenting graphics on screens. Enabling users to ""feel"" digital graphics has the potential to redefine experiences across a wide range of applications, including education, entertainment, and product design.  Haptic interfaces offer access to visual information when users must look elsewhere.  They also introduce interactions the combine touch with other senses to enhance tasks like operating machines from a distance, providing a person with the sense of being present elsewhere, and exploring complex scientific data or medical images.<br/><br/>A key hurdle that has prevented people from living in this multimedia digital world is the lack of actuation technology specifically designed for tactile haptics, thereby limiting the palette of haptic interactions available to designers. Most work which incorporates tactile haptics in computation use vibration motors, which do not take advantage of the wide range of possible sensations and receptors in people’s skin. This project will make use of the enormous amount of innovation that has occurred in stimuli-responsive soft materials, and create high-resolution, dynamic and rich tactile digital graphical content. The investigators will develop novel tactile haptic technologies for digital illustrations through an iterative process in which haptic perception tests and functional evaluations will inform materials specifications based on three main research objectives: (1) Identify the potential of stimuli-responsive soft materials to create haptic pixels to render black and white graphical information to users through touch. (2) Incorporating dynamic material response into tactile pixels to expand the capabilities of rendered graphical content. (3) Augmenting the richness of graphical content rendered for users through an increase of the dynamic mechanical capabilities of tactile pixels. Through this proposed work, the investigators will bridge the gap between materials, haptics, and human-computer interaction research to create new tactile digital expressions. These advances will enable and accelerate new user interfaces and interactions through this underutilized information channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, manufacturers often rely on trial-and-error methods that waste time, energy, and materials, and make it difficult to use recycled plastics due to their variability. The system can predict if a part will meet quality standards before it is finished and can automatically adjust machine settings to reduce mistakes. This saves energy (12–15%), lowers scrap rates, and makes it easier to use more recycled materials without losing quality. The technology will first help medical device companies reduce costly production errors and speed up approvals, improving patient safety. It will also help automotive and consumer product companies make strong, reliable products while using more recycled plastics. By cutting waste and energy use, this system supports cleaner manufacturing and helps U.S. companies stay competitive.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops and validates a hybrid (physics- and artificial intelligence-driven) closed-loop control system for injection molding. The system combines real-time multivariate in-mold sensing (pressure, temperature, shrinkage) with machine-state signals (injection speed, hold pressure, cooling, screw rotation speed, switchover points) to model melt-state dynamics. This approach integrates physics-based models of flow, viscoelasticity, shrinkage, shear, and crystallization with Gaussian Process Regression, Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares, and AI-based algorithms to enable part-quality inference before ejection. Phase I objectives are: (1) demonstrate predictive quality control with decision cycles under 500 milliseconds, (2) optimize cycle time through dynamic control of hold and cooling phases, (3) validate robustness when molding high recycled resin content (targets: 70–80% polypropylene, ~70% polyethylene) compared to virgin resins, and (4) establish data integrity protocols consistent with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and ISO 13485 standards. Data collection will be conducted at the University of Massachusetts Lowell using a pre-instrumented press and molds. Expected outcomes include predictive models with <5% error on quality metrics, energy efficiency gains of 12–15%, and proof-of-concept adaptive controls.

This project aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying the collective swimming of bacteria in dense bacterial suspensions—a model system for studying emergent collective dynamics in active living matter. Specifically, the project will utilize an engineered bacterial strain that allows precise control of their swimming behavior and enables imaging of single cells within dense populations. The new strain will facilitate the investigation of microscopic dynamics at the level of individual bacteria within collectively moving populations. The findings will provide not only crucial experimental benchmarks for addressing important questions about the microscopic origins of collective behaviors in active matter but also guiding principles to engineer novel active materials. The project will also contribute to undergraduate curriculum development and support outreach activities for preschool-aged children in the Twin Cities area.<br/><br/>Technical summary:<br/><br/>This project will investigate the microscopic dynamics of dense bacterial suspensions, which exhibit collective motion known as bacterial turbulence—a canonical example of emergent behavior in active matter. The research will be organized into two interconnected tasks: (1) Engineering a fluorescently labeled engineered bacterial strain with tunable swimming speed and tumble frequency, enabling individual cells to be imaged within a dense population using multi-channel imaging; (2) Imaging and analyzing the microscopic dynamics of individual bacteria within collectively swimming suspensions to reveal how the behavior of single bacteria contributes to global flow patterns. In particular, the project will extract the swimming speed as well as the orientation of individual bacteria in a dense suspension and examine the correlation between single bacterial dynamics and local turbulent flow properties. The results of the project will clarify both the role of individual bacterial swimming in driving active turbulence and the reciprocal influence of turbulent flow on single-cell dynamics. These findings will serve to test and distinguish between competing theories in active matter. In addition, the engineered bacterial strain designed in the project will be available for a broad range of active matter and microbiology research. In terms of broader impact, the project will contribute to the development of undergraduate fluid mechanics curriculum and support outreach activities on science and engineering topics for preschool-aged children at the University of Minnesota Child Development Center.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, CO and CO2 hydrogenation are critical components in the industrial production of methanol, one of the most important platform chemicals in the chemical industry.  Improving our understanding of these reactions will improve the competitiveness of the US chemical industry while potentially lowering energy and capital costs.  These reactions rely on catalytic conversion processes that occur at low temperatures and high pressures.  The high pressure drives the CO and CO2 molecules onto the metal catalyst surface, resulting in crowded surfaces, where molecular interactions among bound intermediates play a key role in changing the reaction dynamics and activating strong chemical bonds. This project will examine the mechanistic role of densely covered surfaces in mediating the various CO and CO2 hydrogenation reactions.  The effort will focus on two benchmark systems:  methanol synthesis on Cu-based catalysts and methanation on Ni-based catalysts.  These systems will be probed with complementary kinetic, spectroscopic, isotopic, and computational studies examining the role of these extended catalytic microenvironments. Educational videos discussing scientific principles and methods in catalysis research broadcast over social media channels accessible to researchers of all backgrounds will provide training and broaden awareness of science and engineering principles involved in the production of fuels.<br/><br/>This research is based on the premise that higher entropic demands of bimolecular reactions among bound surface intermediates on densely crowded surfaces are compensated by lower energy barriers for catalytic reactions on such surfaces.   The research efforts are motivated by previous work, which showed the high pressure and low temperature conditions of methanol synthesis over Cu-based catalysts result in Cu surfaces highly covered with H-adatoms. Such high H-coverages provide novel routes for CO2 activation via molecular intermediates that are only stable on surfaces with high H-adatom coverage. The project will involve the systematic, intentional generation of high H-atom coverage microenvironments.  Microenvironments will be controlled by changing pressures, temperatures, gas composition, titrants, and surface composition.  Reversibility formalisms, spectroscopic methods, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be used to develop a kinetic framework to understand the reaction environments.

Protozoa are rarely in the public mind, except as potential pathogens.  What’s overlooked is that protozoa have all the functions of larger organisms, but confined to a single cell.  The ciliate Tetrahymena exhibits particular virtuosity by organizing surface structures into exquisitely complex geometries.  Animals have mastered the art of organizing their tissues along two major axes, one defining anterior/posterior (heads vs tails), the other defining dorsal/ventral (back vs front).  In contrast, ciliates have expanded their organizational geometry beyond this to develop circumferential patterning as well, so that their tiny cilia (used for swimming) are symmetrically arranged in a circular pattern around the cell, while more complex organelles are distributed at precise, and unique cellular longitudes.  This project investigates how genes shared with humans are deployed by ciliates to achieve this 360-degree circumferential pattern.  As such, it opens an entirely new cellular landscape for scientific exploration.  This easily-grown organism also provides an attractive model for training undergraduates, as both labs continue to produce next-generation scientists via both summer research, and undergraduate laboratory courses involving advanced microscopy.<br/><br/>Ciliates provide a novel paradigm for studying intracellular pattern in living cells.  Animals organize cell and tissue types primarily along two dimensions, the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, with modest differentiation between left and right.  Individual animal cells are typically polarized in one dimension, along the apical-basal axis.  One must look to some of the ‘simplest’ life forms (the ciliated protozoa) to discover mechanisms that go beyond two-dimensional cell planning, and manifest patterning in a 3rd dimension, that of circumferential patterning.  Recent work by the two PIs has identified a suite of genes encoding Polo kinases and PKA homologs, that localize to hundreds of basal bodies populating the ciliate cell cortex.  These kinases decorate basal bodies in discrete cortical domains, and may play a role in licensing specific meridians along which organelles assemble (e.g. the oral apparatus and contractile vacuole pores).  The PIs hypothesize that ciliate pattern is driven by phosphorylation cascades radiating from basal bodies that serve as cortical signalosomes.  In this model, cortical phosphorylation domains interact, to repress or reinforce one another across the cell surface licensing regions of the cortex to initiate construction of organelle assembly platforms.  This study offers access to a genuinely novel intracellular patterning landscape.  This investigation will utilize targeted gene knockouts, GFP-tagging, and morphological manipulation to interrogate cortical pattern mechanisms in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila.  Localization and co-localization of gene products in wild-type and mutant cells as well as within cells undergoing pattern reorganization following cortical disruption will be explored with the aim of understanding how various kinases control organelle assembly along specific cortical meridians.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes changes to the chemical makeup of the atmosphere and soils, the frequency of events like fire and drought, the rate at which species go extinct, and the spread of weeds, pests, and pathogens. Many of these changes directly affect ecosystems and their ability to provide important services on which humans depend. The effects of environmental change occur over many decades and may vary through time. Predicting the effect of these changes depends on long-term experiments. Long-term feedbacks between organisms and the environment can make these changes stronger, weaker, or even reverse them. For example, soils under retired farmlands keep getting more fertile and store more atmospheric carbon for decades, but how fast this happens depends on the diversity of plant species in the area. Researchers at the Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research Program (CDR) will collect long-term data in retired agricultural lands, prairies, savannas, and forests. These data will be combined with mathematical models to better understand how ecosystems respond to many environmental changes happening at the same time. CDR’s education and outreach team along with the Cedar Creek field station staff will continue to work with community partners to recruit, train, and support a STEM workforce. The project will create opportunities for K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, educators, policy makers, and the public. These opportunities include school field trips, a high school internship program, and onsite apprenticeships that provide training in science education.<br/><br/>Researchers at CDR LTER will use long-term observations and experiments, theory, and models to achieve a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the role of plant biodiversity change, including lags and feedbacks, in determining ecosystem responses to a changing environment. This understanding will be achieved by leveraging CDR’s long-term research platforms that, taken together, manipulate or observe plant biodiversity under ambient and experimentally altered environmental conditions in a range of terrestrial ecosystems to document responses across scales, from leaf-scale physiology to the whole ecosystem scale. This hypothesis-based work will advance knowledge by maintaining CDR’s many research platforms and by starting four new experiments strategically positioned to resolve critical knowledge gaps about community assembly and organism-environment feedbacks. CDR scientists also will start collecting new data on carbon dynamics in directly comparable treatments spanning existing research platforms. In addition, researchers will use ecological theory, modeling, multi-site experiments, and synthesis activities to increase the generality of the insights arising from CDR site-based studies. Taken together, these projects will reveal when and why multi-decadal lags and long-term feedbacks occur as well as the role of biodiversity change on lags and feedbacks to ecosystem functioning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Once generated, long-wavelength (low-mode) NIWs propagate long distances toward the equator before meeting an unknown fate, while short-wavelength (high-mode) NIWs persist for weeks under the storm track, maintaining ubiquitous upper-ocean shear. The exact partitioning between low- and high-mode NIWs is unknown, but relevant to ocean/climate feedback because breaking NIWs drive diapycnal mixing that affects the vertical transports of heat and carbon in the ocean. Low-mode NIWs are believed to scatter over rough topography where they may enhance deep boundary mixing. High-mode NIWs produce velocity shear associated with total kinetic energy dissipation through a variety of processes such as wave-wave or wave-mean interactions, thus contributing to open-water upper-ocean mixing. This project will synthesize existing NIW observations, theory, and numerical models to create a global NIW prediction system, which will help answer some basic questions that have persisted despite recent progress with theory and process studies: (1) How do dynamics in the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL) shape NIW vertical wavenumber spectrum? (2) What is the fate of low-mode NIWs? and (3) How well do linearized models that include realistic wind, stratification, and mesoscale circulation predict upper-ocean shear?  Results from this project will influence the next generation of mixing parameterizations for ocean-climate models. This project will also impact STEM education by supporting a PhD student and undergraduate summer interns. Public outreach events, such as the “Science on Deck” open houses on the research vessel (R/V) Blue Heron, will be conducted, and ocean modeling software and data products developed during this project will be open source and publicly available.<br/><br/>This effort will analyze novel high-resolution observations and numerical models.

The NIW models will utilize a variety of OSBL turbulence models coupled with two NIW propagation models, the Coupled-mode Shallow Water (CSW) model and the Young and Ben Jelloul (YBJ) model. First, OSBL models will be run with realistic atmospheric forcing to examine how the turbulent stress profile determines the NIW vertical-wavenumber spectrum. These results will be compared against HDSS vertical-wavenumber spectra to identify which OSBL dynamics are critical for replicating observations. Next, the CSW model is run to examine global propagation of low-mode NIWs. These simulations will be examined for consistency with mooring energy fluxes and then used to quantify island trapping, coastal reflection, and scattering by topography and depth-dependent mean flows (taken from the HYCOM ocean general circulation model). Lastly, the evolution of upper-ocean shear will be examined by running high-resolution YBJ simulations with realistic forcing, mesoscale flow, topography, and low-mode boundary forcing. These simulations will be compared with HDSS and lowered-ADCP data to explain global variations in upper-ocean shear.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using new, cutting-edge methods, the team will measure changes in rainfall intensity, flooding, and other climate shifts in ways that were not possible before. The knowledge gained will improve our ability to anticipate and manage risks such as flooding and extreme rainfall, strengthening our nation’s resilience and protecting public welfare.

As Numerical Linear Algebra plays a crucial role in Deep Learning models, this trend presents unprecedented opportunities for experts in numerical analysis and linear algebra to contribute to ongoing AI research. This proposal represents a step toward capitalizing on this opportunity. The focus of the proposed work is not on applying AI to solve a specific problem, but rather on enhancing AI methods themselves by exploiting insights from numerical methods to optimize the Deep Learning process. This process is time-consuming, energy-intensive, resource-demanding, and overall very costly. Therefore, any improvements that can speed up the process are likely to have a significant impact. The investigators will leverage their experience in numerical methods to develop a number of techniques for accelerating the training of large AI models.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop techniques that exploit both accelerators and preconditioners to speed up iterative procedures used in training deep learning models.  The same combination of preconditioning and acceleration techniques is central to the effectiveness of iterative solution methods for linear systems. Acceleration methods such as Anderson/Pulay mixing or the Reduced Rank Extrapolation method, among others, have had immense success across various fields of science and engineering. However, in the context of deep learning, these methods face challenges, particularly since they were not developed for stochastic sequences common in deep learning.  The team will investigate the relationship between mini-batching, a technique used for sampling subfunctions in stochastic methods, and its impact on both the convergence speed and the accuracy of the resulting models. Simple diagonal preconditioning methods have already been incorporated into optimization techniques in deep learning.  The research team will explore more advanced preconditioning methods based on various approximations to the Fisher information matrix, a matrix that measures the amount of information that the observed data provides about the parameters. It has been shown that replacing the Hessian in second order methods by the Fisher matrix yields a more meaningful form of scaling of the variables, leading to better convergence and generalization. The investigating team will consider various methods for obtaining inexpensive approximations of the Fisher matrix and for combining them with accelerators. The proposed work is expected to benefit research in ""scientific machine learning"" by promoting participation of numerical linear algebra specialists in AI research. The PIs plan on several specific activities to promote the dissemination of knowledge in machine learning, such as writing a book on the topic of numerical methods in machine learning or offering tutorials and short courses. These activities will stimulate the interest of students in a field of increasing importance and that it will help with the immersion of those students from other areas, e.g., mathematics, into data-related disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research involves gathering, scoping, and synthesizing 25 years of research and evaluation on Family Learning Conversations conducted in museum settings, and formally incorporating practitioner-generated knowledge to spark the next generation of design and research on family learning in museums. This project is structured differently than a traditional synthesis in order to achieve the broadest impacts. Museum practitioners drive the synthesis, contributing their own practice-based knowledge, questions, and critical commentary to each part of the synthesis work. For practitioners, literature syntheses that identify how their existing ideas relate to research findings provide ecologically grounded and accessible insights for design. For researchers, understanding how practitioners identify learning or valuable interactions distinct from what has been valued in FLC research historically provides fertile ground for innovation in research methods and research questions. By bringing researchers with expertise in informal learning, video-based discourse analysis, and evidence synthesis into collaboration with museum educators, designers, and evaluators from institutions of varying size and emphases, the project is synthesizing research knowledge and practice knowledge that is fundamentally practitioner-driven, making knowledge in informal learning research more accessible to practitioners, and generating new questions and insights for further practical and research development.<br/><br/>This work contributes directly to advancing knowledge through synthesis of 25 years of museum Family Learning Conversations research in direct response to museum practitioners, while attending to how shifting values in museum education have shaped prior research and require new directions for future work.

These image modalities involve an inherent trade-off between spatial and spectral resolution: HSIs provide fine spectral detail but coarse spatial resolution, whereas MSIs offer the reverse. Spectral image fusion techniques seek to combine the strengths of both by integrating an HSI and MSI of the same region to produce fused images with high-resolution information in both domains, supporting various tasks such as pixel classification, target identification, and change detection. However, many existing fusion methods operate under the assumption that the spectral images are co-registered (i.e., covering the same region and sharing the same coordinates), whereas in practice the data are often spatially misaligned by pixel shifts, rotations, and other distortions (collectively referred to as “unregistered”), typically arising from differences in sensors or imaging platforms. Despite its fundamental practical importance and considerable interest, the fusion of unregistered spectral images still lacks rigorous theoretical underpinnings and reliable algorithms. This project addresses these gaps by developing new analytical and computational methods to establish a solid theoretical and algorithmic foundation for this long-standing and practically significant problem, enabling performance-guaranteed fusion of unregistered spectral data in real-world scenarios. Beyond remote sensing, the outcomes are expected to benefit areas such as cross-platform medical imaging and domain adaptation/transfer in machine learning. The project also offers undergraduate research opportunities, providing students with training in machine learning, optimization, and image/signal processing.<br/><br/>This project develops a unified, unsupervised framework for fusion of unregistered spectral images with provable guarantees, tackling key challenges including spatial misalignment, lack of training data, and nonrigid deformation. Thrust 1 focuses on establishing theoretical foundations by integrating spectral unmixing with adversarial learning through diversified distribution matching in a latent spatial domain, enabling provable spatio-spectral super-resolution under practical, unregistered scenarios. Thrust 2 extends this framework to more complex real-world cases such as those involving unknown and potentially large nonrigid deformations. Thrust 3 develops stable and efficient optimization algorithms for the proposed fusion formulations, tailored to adversarial learning in latent domains and addressing the limitations of standard optimizers. Validation on semi-realistic and real-world datasets is used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methods. Expected outcomes include new theoretical insights, practical algorithms with convergence guarantees, and reproducible benchmarks to advance unregistered spectral image fusion and its applications in machine learning, signal processing, and scientific imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although oxidative decarboxylation reactions are an attractive approach to generate a variety of value-added targets from simple and abundant precursors, there are limited examples of such reactions that operate with high efficiency and selectivity. The approach will leverage distinct oxidant-based conditions to achieve disparate but related decarboxylative transformations. First, copper-catalysts paired with nitroxyl radical oxidants will enable selective dehydrogenation while mitigating decarboxylation to access unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Second, a new metal-free oxidant-mediated decarboxylative amination will generate primary amines from heteroaromatic carboxylic acids. Mechanistic studies will provide a fundamental understanding of the influence of the oxidant on the decarboxylation steps and will lay the groundwork for establishing a library of reliable and predictive metal-catalyzed and metal-free decarboxylation reactions of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

O-fucosylation, or the transfer of a single fucose sugar to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, is a newly discovered, essential protein modification catalyzed by the SPINDLY (SPY) enzyme. SPY is critical for proper plant growth and development, regulating the plant’s response to environmental signals. Due to a lack of tools available to label and isolate SPY-specific O-fucosylated proteins, there is limited information on SPY’s overall biological function. To address this, Professor Joiner and her students will develop two labeling strategies to tag and isolate SPY-specific O-fucosylated proteins. These strategies will enable chemical or enzymatic labeling to attach a functional handle to O-fucosylated proteins that can be used for their isolation and characterization. This will expand the current toolbox for studying the essential SPY enzyme and its biological function in plants. In addition, this research will increase access for St. Olaf students to interdisciplinary science, training and mentoring them to be independent chemical biology researchers.<br/><br/>Professor Joiner and her students will develop two labeling strategies to isolate and study nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosylated proteins in plants. While tools are available for labeling large, glycan structures on the outside of cells containing O-fucose, there are no tools to label single intracellular O-fucosylated proteins. This limits mechanistic studies of O-fucosylation and the SPY glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the reaction. The first strategy will use bioorthogonal GDP-fucose analogs that SPY will be able to use to transfer the modified fucose to proteins and click chemistry to add a functional handle to these proteins for isolation and characterization. The second strategy will use enzymatic labeling to add a modified sugar to SPY-specific O-fucosylated proteins for chemical functionalization using bioorthogonal probes. Both strategies use bioorthogonal chemistry to enable the efficient and selective isolation of SPY-specific O-fucosylated proteins both in vitro and in vivo, expanding the toolbox for mechanistic studies into the catalytic and substrate selection mechanisms of SPY enzymes and the role of intracellular O-fucosylation in plants and other SPY-containing species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, how many mutations drove the tumor's progression, and what specific mutations were most important? Doctors can use this information to determine the best courses of treatment and the frequency of surveillance tests. In recent years, scientists have developed novel sequencing technologies -- including single-cell sequencing, multi-region sequencing, and sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). In this project, the investigators will develop new mathematical and statistical tools to analyze the large amounts of data generated by these new sequencing technologies.  Their methods will leverage the latest knowledge of biological mechanisms driving cancer progression to develop constrained statistical models that maximize insights from cancer sequencing data.  The investigators will incorporate real-world limitations of cancer sequencing data availability, e.g. limited time points and samples.  This project will support the training of graduate students in inter-disciplinary science that combines mathematics, statistics, and bioinformatics.<br/> <br/>The mathematical tools will be built upon the underlying principles of population genetics which govern tumor progression.  Due to the rapid expansion of tumor cell populations, work will primarily be done with branching process models; however, variants of the branching process model that incorporate finite carrying capacity will also be used, allowing for the accurate representation of real-world observations of tumor cell growth rates that decrease over time. Within the context of these stochastic models, the investigators will study several quantities related to new genomic sequencing technologies. For example, they will study the behavior of the site frequency spectrum in a branching process model with selection. This study will enable the development of tools to better detect the presence of so-called driver mutations in the genetic history of tumors. The investigators will also develop techniques based on multi-type branching processes for understanding data generated from multi-region sequencing. Additionally, techniques for utilizing single-cell sequencing to identify the mutations responsible for driving tumor progression will be developed.

These structures have a wide range of applications, including vibration control, noise reduction, energy harvesting, sensing, and communication technologies. However, a major challenge limits their practical deployment: when these materials are manufactured as real, finite components, as opposed to idealized, infinite structures, surface waves develop along their boundaries that are poorly understood and difficult to predict. The research funded by this award seeks to bridge a critical gap in scientific understanding by creating a new theoretical framework to describe, manipulate and ultimately harness the sensing potential of surface waves in phononic crystals. This project serves the national interest by advancing non-destructive evaluation techniques for infrastructure safety and aerospace applications, improving quality control of next-generation composite materials, and enabling more efficient acoustic devices for medical diagnostics. The project will also support workforce development by training graduate students in advanced computational and experimental methods, while generating fundamental insights that will benefit a broad scientific community working in wave physics, material characterization, and additive manufacturing.<br/> <br/>Building on preliminary work focused on scalar waves, this research aims to establish a comprehensive framework for analyzing, controlling, and harnessing surface-bound waves in phononic crystals through three interconnected objectives. First, the mathematical concept of surface Bloch waves will be formulated as the boundary layers native to traction-free surfaces of phononic crystals, which will lead to the development of a unit-cell-based, reduced-order model that predicts their dispersion, waveforms, power flow, and spatial decay (or “skin depth”). Second, this research will explore how engineered geometric design of the traction-free surfaces, through controlled orientation, elevation, and periodic undulation of surface cuts, can be leveraged to manipulate the surface Bloch waves. The reduced-order model will support efficient parametric exploration of the geometric design space. Third, an experimental study using laser Doppler vibrometry will be conducted to (i) verify the theoretical framework, and (ii) develop a non-destructive evaluation methodology that extends widely used spectral-analysis-of-surface-waves (SASW) technique to as-fabricated phononic crystals. This project is expected to yield new insights into the physics of surface waves and boundary layers in periodic media, while delivering practical tools for inverse characterization of additively manufactured phononic crystals.

Results will elucidate and improve predictions of OM accumulation and degradation.   Assemblages of iron oxide minerals and organic matter, hereafter referred to as Fe-OM, are major regulators of global carbon and nutrient cycles, with OM often protected by minerals through complex and interconnected chemical processes. Using model compounds and whole root exudates, the team will examine how plant exudates transform Fe-OM and impact the distribution of OM within the solid and liquid phases and at their interfaces as minerals change over time.  Findings will elucidate mechanisms of OM stabilization and disruption that can shed light on how plant and microbial processes affect OM stability, potentially leading to new strategies for increasing soil carbon and supporting sustainable land use. The project will also develop open-source machine learning algorithms to predict how organic molecules react with minerals in soil, with applications to understanding the fate of various chemicals, including pollutants.<br/><br/>This project aims to test the hypothesis that plant exudate molecules that act as both reductants and chelates may be particularly effective at promoting the release of Fe and OM from Fe-OM, and that certain Fe-OM materials resist transformation.  It combines experiments using varied model organic compounds and root exudates and synthesized Fe minerals with a broad suite of experiments and analyses. The three primary aims are (1) quantify the distribution and fractionation of organic matter during Fe(II) catalyzed iron oxide transformations; (2) identify which exudate model compounds and whole root exudate molecules disrupt Fe-OM, releasing dissolved OM and Fe(II) and promoting phase transformations, and understand the relevant modes of action; and (3) characterize the impact of chemical gradients on OM redistribution upon introduction of Fe(II), model exudates, and whole root exudate using flow-through reactors to better mimic field conditions. The three tasks will focus on progressively narrower Fe-OM materials and exudate chemistries that exhibit the greatest differences in reactivity to ultimately reveal mechanisms and determine which Fe-OM are most susceptible and resistant to those processes.

Experimental studies to directly support (or disprove) the role of these structural parameters in molecular electronic films will advance the level of understanding needed to modify current models of charge conduction. The outcomes of these experiments will eliminate assumptions about the molecular structures through which charges are transported efficiently and could be used to make existing models more accurate and predictive. This will advance the level of understanding in the area of molecular design and synthesis by prescribing the features that need to be built into next generation molecules to impart efficient thin film performance.

This project will focus on a new mechanism for assessing how nanoplastics are released from bulk plastics. During and after their useful lifetime, plastics often slide over surfaces and collide with surfaces.  For example, plastic litter slides over land surfaces driven by wind or stormwater. Plastics in moving sediments or agricultural soil collide repeatedly with hard surfaces.

This project focuses on a less explored mechanism - surface abrasive wear at the nanoscale. Abrasive wear results from the penetration of a harder particle and/or protruding surface (i.e., asperity) into the softer plastic surface, causing plastic deformation and potentially debris removal in sliding contact. The central hypothesis is that plastics sliding over a surface with nanoroughness creates nanoscale wear and the release of nanometer-size debris.  The project leverages the novel single-asperity nanoscratch method and other advanced atomic force microscopy modes to visualize the mechanism of nanoplastic generation and release from abrasive wear and to identify key physicochemical properties of nanoplastics that result in health impacts.  Results will reveal how and why different abrasion conditions, plastic properties, and pre-exposure to sunlight shape the nanoplastic release profile, which can enable risk assessment and screening tools for the design of sustainable polymers.

This reactivity is perhaps most familiar in the form of an acetylene (ethyne, the simplest alkyne) torch, which gives off considerably more heat than, say, methane (natural gas) when combusted with oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water.

This is achieved by enabling 5G networks to utilize information (e.g., vehicle trajectory and speed) provided by remote driving applications to make intelligent decisions to speed up the delivery of sensor and command-and-control data that are critical to remote driving, whereas CAVs can also take advantage of vertical-aware predictions made by 5G networks to decide when and how to transmit data. Additional innovations include incorporation of integrated 5G and cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technologies for cooperative situation awareness to further ensure safe remote driving operations. The phased approach to developing the proposed solutions and demonstrating their capabilities will ensure a high chance of successful execution, truly moving the needle with transformative impacts on relevant industrial sectors. The project represents close collaboration across three academic institutions and two industry leaders in key relevant sectors providing an accelerated pathway to technology transition. By demonstrating the value of vertical-aware advanced 5G/NextG networks in support of remote and cooperative driving and other industrial use cases, this project will help create new opportunities and business models for both mobile network operators and network equipment vendors for sustained investments in network innovations. It will also help accelerate adoption of autonomous driving with teleoperation capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wild animals may not have bug spray or medication to protect them from these pesky parasites, but they have other tricks up their sleeves. This includes moving to habitats that help them recover from an infection or avoid the parasite in the first place. Yet this strategy may lead to an ‘out of the frying pan, into the fire’ situation: A dog walker who moves to a forest path may avoid grass-dwelling ticks but be faced with blood-sucking mosquitoes instead. This balance is also critical for wild migratory animals that travel between different habitats, though how this balance is achieved in nature remains unclear. This project uses mathematical equations and published data to explore how migrating animals time their movement to cope with parasites, just like dog walkers avoiding a forest walk at dusk when mosquitoes are out in full force. It will also explore what happens when migratory animals have more than one infection to deal with, like managing your dog’s infection with both ticks and tapeworms at the same time. The research findings will be communicated to other scientists through conference presentations and publications, and to elementary school and undergraduate students through teaching modules. The project also involves developing Wikipedia pages about scientists, and training graduate students.<br/><br/>Despite recognition that parasites can shape seasonal migration of their hosts, important knowledge gaps remain: (i) existing conceptual frameworks typically focus on a single mechanism linking parasites, and (ii) most existing models start with a fully migratory or non-migratory host population in the absence of infection. Via the development of novel theoretical models supported by existing empirical evidence, this project will 1) determine the best timing of migration between two environments, given the tradeoffs of infection with different parasite species inhabiting each environment; and 2) determine how accounting for multiple parasite species changes our understanding of how parasites influence partial migration. Thus, this research generates a comprehensive understanding of the eco-evolutionary interactions between host movement and parasites, something that is essential for predicting the responses of migratory hosts and their parasites to anthropogenic change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples range from ecosystems with possible tipping points and extinction, to sudden changes in heart rhythm, and to self-organization in early development. Mathematical theory aims at predicting such changes, finding mechanisms that can prevent dramatic outcomes, or identifying causes of malfunction. Much of the theory developed in the mathematical sciences addresses transitions in simple dynamical systems, leading to universal qualitative predictions for qualitative changes in behavior. This project is concerned with case studies of transitions in large and complex systems, in particular with situations where such systems behave in apparently anomalous ways, challenging our understanding inferred from existing theory. Examples show how the complexity of large systems can eliminate system memory in transitions, thus facilitating easy switching between qualitatively different states with implications  in systems biology. Transitions also involve intricate interplay between spatial organization and temporal evolution, with implications for the formation of ecological clusters and niches, as well as for the emergence of spiral waves in cardiac arrhythmia.

The project aims to identify coherent structures that organize the dynamics, as pacemakers, or as crystalline phases, and study their instabilities as well as the impact of spatial heterogeneity. Specifically, the project investigates interacting particle systems with competing attractive and repulsive forces, which exhibit a striking reversible phase transition from a perfectly mixed state to sorted states and states with clusters and vacuum regions. The anchoring of spiral waves at impurities and a geometric instability leading to bending of spiral arms will also be investigated.

For example, LC can be used to understand the composition and chemistry of innovative materials (e.g., biodegradable plastics), determine concentrations of biomarkers of disease in fluids such as urine or plasma, and determine impurities or breakdown products in life-saving medicines. This academic/industrial collaboration seeks to develop novel approaches to mobile phase delivery (i.e., pumping systems) and detection of separated compounds – two of the key elements of any LC process – which will in turn enable new, faster ways to develop LC methods, and more efficient and reliable analyses. The data that these approaches produce will accelerate the widespread integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence into LC techniques.

Recent work in the Stoll Laboratory has yielded methodology for increasing the rate of acquisition of high-quality retention data, however this work has also identified technology gaps that prevent further development toward simultaneous improvement of retention data quality, and retention data acquisition rate. This collaborative research project will address these gaps through the development of two key technologies: 1)  a novel, specialized flow path design for physically registering analytes both entering and exiting the LC column, in order to enhance retention data precision; and 2) mobile phase delivery technology that enables ultra-fast gradient elution separations by application of a constant pressure solvent delivery mode, in order to eliminate the gradient formation errors originating from rapid pressure changes. We anticipate that these technologies will routinely facilitate high-quality LC measurements on the sub-5-second timescale, both for the purpose of building large retention databases, and in applications such as high-throughput screening laboratories. The large datasets yielded by these technologies will in turn be used by Stoll’s group to continue development of predictive simulation tools that support increased autonomous operation of LC instruments, and increase the efficiency of research by focusing experimental lab-based LC measurements on conditions most likely to be useful.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader goal of this endeavor is to strike to a more equitable balance between lecture-based curricula and hands-on learning in graduate education. <br/><br/>Many membrane protein transporters are comprised of a single polypeptide chain that contains inverted repeats within its structure. This research will investigate the underpinnings of membrane protein evolution by using mutations to derive a quantitative relationship between function and the free energy distinguishing conformational states required for function.

Many stars end their lives in violent explosions that produce intense flashes of light analogous to cosmic fireworks. Studying such cosmic explosions holds enormous potential for learning about the most extreme states of matter, the origin of elements in the periodic table, and the evolution of the cosmos. In recent years, puzzling new classes of cosmic explosions are being discovered where the explosion is so energetic that the resulting blast wave expands at nearly the speed of light.. A 3-year research program led by investigators at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities aims to develop novel and accurate theoretical models that will be used to interpret existing and upcoming observations of relativistic cosmic explosions. A primary task of this project will be to develop code that accurately calculates how light is produced and escapes such explosions. Award activities will inspire public interest, increase public participation, and train the next generation of scientists through a summer outreach program within the Minnesota state parks network, enhancing the elementary school astronomy curriculum of the Como Planetarium, and the training of undergraduate and postgraduate students.<br/><br/>Theoretical models of cosmic explosions will incorporate a full treatment of relativistic effects, which are critical when velocities are comparable to the speed of light. This will extend existing models, which either treat these effects using simplistic approximations or neglect them altogether. After developing this code, the investigators will apply the model to a wide range of observed relativistic explosions. The predictions of this model will allow accurate and unbiased inferences of the explosion properties of fast blue optical transients, the local environments of supermassive black holes (using data from jetted tidal-disruption events), and the properties of merging neutron stars, which can shed light on the behavior of nuclear matter at the highest densities in the Universe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The remarkable array of properties they offer has enabled numerous technologies that include lightweight transportation, food packaging, membrane materials for clean water and energy applications. However, a long-standing challenge has been the incorporation of chemical functional groups into polyolefins that would enable explosive growth in potential applications thus fostering economic growth in this class of materials. Moreover, while polyethylene has enjoyed some recycling success, such functional polyolefins would enable new recycling strategies that would bring important benefits to this immensely useful class of polymers especially in terms of promoting a self-sustaining circular polyolefin economy. This includes reuse and recycling of locally prepared and utilized plastics. The work described in this proposal will significantly advance our understanding of how to readily prepare the target functional polyolefins using the modern tools of polymer synthesis, which will in turn clear the path for implementation of new technologies. This work will emphasize new materials applications for next generation thermally, mechanically, and chemically robust polyethylenes as high performance plastics and membranes. The proposed activities will benefit society in several ways. These activities will improve the well-being of individuals given the urgent need to solve our pressing plastics predicament: society depends on these polymeric materials and continually expects increased performance but suffers consequences from the associated pollution that can result.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The work described in this proposal will focus on how to efficiently prepare functional telechelic polyolefins with high atom economy using an approach that combines metathesis polymerization and catalytic hydrogenation using a dual function catalyst. Specifically, Project 1 will establish a wholly new strategy to create crosslinked polyethylene using an unprecedented reactive precursor approach that will lead to the material benefits of established crosslinked polyethylenes while adding chemical recyclability and highly tunable molecular features that include molar mass between crosslinks, crystallinity, and functional group concentration. A separate strategy to create high stability PEX materials by eliminating tertiary carbons that are susceptible to oxidative degradation will also be pursued. Project 2 will spearhead the generation and development of new nanostructures and mechanically robust nanoporous materials that have utility in, for example, separation membranes and in the formation of nanobubbles for water treatment and biomedical applications. Importantly, the work proposed will uncover methods that allow for the generation of mechanically robust materials through molecular engineering of the block polymer structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research area of K-theory was precisely engineered to achieve this, and for this reason it permeates a wide range of mathematical fields, encoding meaningful information about any setting where there is a reasonable notion of “splitting”. A K-theory machinery stores this data in a topological space, which is able to record which objects break up into smaller pieces, as well as how these splittings occur. Unpacking the data present in a K-theory space and reinterpreting it in terms of the original structures of interest, is both the main goal and the main challenge of the field of K-theory. In this project, the PI will carry out two independent research lines in this direction that aim to make strides in our understanding of the K-theory spaces of manifolds (smooth shapes with no sharp edges or corners, central to geometry and physics) and of Lawvere theories (a main character in universal algebra and logic), using the newly-introduced framework of combinatorial K-theory. A third research line, and an underlying theme throughout this project, pushes the state of the art of combinatorial K-theory, developing tools and paving the way for new examples and applications to come. Integrated into this project is the mentoring and training of students, as well as the organization of a collaborative workshop, the creation of a new professional development class for graduate students on mathematical communication skills, and the development of new active learning materials for undergraduate education that will be made broadly available to the mathematical community. <br/><br/>The emerging subfield of combinatorial K-theory introduces new techniques to study structures whose splittings have a combinatorial flavor; for instance, by placing a focus on complements, instead of quotients or cofibers. Exciting new developments in the field, such as the introduction of new simplicial models and of robust comparison theorems reminiscent of the best features of classical algebraic and homotopical settings, place combinatorial K-theory in an advantageous spot and make this an ideal time for ambitious explorations. In this project, the PI will exploit these recent developments in order to explore three applications of vastly different mathematical flavors. The PI plans to: (a) Give a first computation of K1 of cut-and-paste K-theory for manifolds; (b) Introduce a K-theory of endomorphisms and a version of the Fundamental theorem of K-theory<br/>in the combinatorial setting, with a particular focus on finite sets; and (c) Explore connections between K-theory and logic by constructing localizations for the K-theory of Lawvere theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 800 million patients worldwide live with diabetes and the incidence is increasing. In the US, diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease that is aggravated by patients having an aversion to needles and skipping doses they cannot easily afford. Insulin pills sidestep the need for patients and caregivers to use syringes and needles and will address cost and supply chain issues that arise from the need to refrigerate injectable insulin products. Additionally, insulin pills can resolve therapeutic shortcomings of insulin injections including the potential for incorrect dosing and resultant complications like heart attacks, strokes, eye- and kidney disease. The technology supporting oral insulin is based on the continued development of lipid nanoparticles which promote safety by using lipids that are well known and tested and are approved as inert drug constituents or food additives. This research focuses on increasing the ability of lipid nanoparticles to encapsulate and promote the gastrointestinal absorption of insulin, and extending the shelf life of pills based on lipid nanoparticles.<br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the high medical need for an oral insulin. Based on work supported by a phase I SBIR award that demonstrated the concept of encapsulating insulin in lipid nanoparticles, an insulin pill will be developed.  Because taking insulin by mouth will more closely mimic natural insulin production than subcutaneous injections, the body’s natural processes to balance blood glucose levels should be more engaged.  If these processes were fully engaged, the requirement for glucose monitoring would be eliminated and insulin overdosing, a common problem from subcutaneous injection, would be prevented. However, how much oral insulin dosing will enable natural glucose and insulin control can only be known once an effective oral dosage form is available. By providing an insulin pill made by encapsulating insulin in lipid nanoparticles, and optimizing the ability of lipid nanoparticles to move insulin from the gastrointestinal tract into the body, our research will open up new opportunities to understand human glucose metabolic processes. Our research will also contribute basic, general knowledge about nanoparticle manufacturing, optimization and oral absorption that will close a technology gap in developing oral drugs based on peptides including insulin, vaccines, and GLP-1 drugs as well as other non-peptide drugs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These adaptations could lead to differences in the overall function of the gut microbiome across host species. Improved understanding of variation in gut microbiome composition and function could have important implications for the use of probiotics to improve human health or livestock production.

A central question in animal ecology, therefore, is why animals form groups and what the associated costs and benefits are. Lions in resource-rich savanna habitats have long served as a model for studying social behavior in mammals, with extensive research shedding light on the drivers and consequences of their group living. However, lions also inhabit a range of ecosystems beyond savannas. Recent comparative research by the principal investigator in a forested ecosystem demonstrates that lion social behavior is highly context-dependent, varying significantly with ecological conditions. This project builds on that insight by investigating lion sociality in a semi-arid environment—Kenya’s Tsavo Ecosystem. Using advanced biotelemetry, remote cameras, and direct observations, the study will track individual lions and their groups to identify the ecological drivers of social behavior in this non-model population. The project will also develop a new lion monitoring software, supporting long-term research, education, and conservation efforts. Additionally, by providing immersive field and analytical research experiences for undergraduates and post-baccalaureate researchers, while integrating findings into course curricula, this project advances the NSF mission of building a broad and robust STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Dominant theories in animal behavior limit our understanding of nature by anchoring us to familiar—and sometimes biased—hypotheses derived from studies on iconic or model systems. Lions, for example, have significantly advanced our knowledge of animal sociality due to their complex fission-fusion group structures and the nuanced interplay of cooperation and conflict within and between males and femailes. However, the typical lion in scientific literature pertains to only a few populations inhabiting resource-rich savannas (e.g. Serengeti and Ngorongoro), thereby confining the socio-ecological understanding of a widely distributed species into overly deterministic frameworks. This project seeks to broaden that perspective by integrating detailed observational data with high-resolution movement tracking via proximity-enabled satellite telemetry to 1) examine territorial dynamics of male- and female-groups, and 2) identify individual-level factors governing social cohesion in lions in a prey-scarce, spatiotemporally heterogenous, semi-arid system. The project will also 3) develop a web-based software tool for curating, managing, and analyzing long-term behavioral and demographic data on lions. By moving beyond traditional model habitats, this project will investigate mechanisms underlying individual interactions in lions, and whether these interactions differ within and between males and females amidst varying resources and competition from co-predators. Ultimately, the project aims to reveal how ecological factors influence social decision-making and contribute to the evolutionary understanding of social variation in lions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology uses mechanical recycling to turn discarded apparel into high quality fibers. The U.S. throws away over 17 million tons of apparel and textiles every year. Less than 15% of discarded textiles in the U.S. are recycled, which means a valuable resource is going to waste. By blending these recycled fibers with new plant- or animal-based fibers, the collective fiber length is long enough for spinning into new yarn and manufacturing new textiles. The solution utilizes perennial flax, where the fiber can be harvested in spring and fall with minimal inputs and no tilling for several years.  the use of perennial flax preserves soil from erosion and promotes soil health. Wool from alpaca and sheep provide the long carrier fibers for the mechanically recycled fibers which allow textiles made from these recycled-natural fiber blends to be mechanically recycled again. As the procurement of these grown or recycled fibers as well as manufacturing yarn can happen locally, this can create a regional circular textile economy.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

Two novel technologies are combined to create recycled yarn from discarded apparel: a mechanical fiber shredder textile recycling technology, that recycles textiles into fibers and threads and a novel perennial flax breed that provides an alternative to more resource-intensive annual flax - with long fibers suitable for spinning into yarn. Utilizing existing mini mill yarn spinning technologies, these fibers combine to form functional yarns of many colors, weights, and plies. Replacing products' new fiber with recycled fiber reduces water use, land use, and air pollution.

Specifically, we will determine how the response, typically an electromagnetic wave pulse, propagates through the magnetosphere (radially, azimuthally, or a combination thereof); what wave mode and Poynting flux are associated with this response; and how the wave mode evolves. We will also characterize particle energization, scattering, and loss associated with the passage of the pulse through the dayside magnetosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There, icebergs break off, drifting towards lower latitudes and warmer waters. Along the way the icebergs melt and the rock fragments sink to the seafloor, leaving behind a trail of these rock fragments called ice rafted debris. Ice rafted debris accumulates at the bottom of the ocean and over time preserves a record of activity at their source, the Antarctic ice sheet. In this study investigators will use sediment cores recovered in the Indian Ocean by the Ocean Drilling Program to reconstruct the accumulation of ice rafted debris over time. The drill site is about 500 miles north of the Antarctic continent, and in the path of the ice bergs that it sheds. When looking at the variations in ice rafted debris over time, the team will obtain a record of changes in the glacial activity of the Antarctic ice sheet through time. The study is motivated by the mystery surrounding changes in glacial activity in response to changes in the shape of Earth’s orbit around the sun, the wobble of its axis, and the degree of the tilt of the Earth’s axis, the so-called Milankovitch cycles. For a period of time between about 1.2 and 1.6 million years ago, it is not clear if ice sheet growth and melt responded to changes in incoming solar energy related to changes in the shape of the orbit or to changes in its tilt toward or away from the sun. This study will contribute data to help understand how these external mechanisms cause variations in the size and behavior of Antarctic ice sheets. Investigators will conduct this research alongside a number of undergraduate students and one graduate student. Records of ice rafted debris provide an ideal teaching tool as they are reasonably easy to assemble by students independently (after initial training) and thus provide students with a sense of self-reliance and self-confidence, increasing their motivation to remain in a STEM related field. Thus, ice rafted debris is an ideal proxy to teach students about paleoclimate and paleoceanography. Broader impacts activities include training and mentoring undergraduate students and a graduate student, outreach with a local middle school, and efforts to expand access in STEM.<br/><br/>Legacy Ocean Drilling Program Site 745B - drilled during Leg 119 in 1988 south of the polar front in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean - provides a rare opportunity to study paleoclimate at the full orbital scale back into the late Miocene (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1989) in a vastly understudied region of the world ocean. Investigators propose to construct records of ice rafted debris (IRD) to infer Antarctic ice margin dynamics during the early Pleistocene (~1.1-1.8 Ma) and during specific late Pleistocene interglacial intervals (Marine Isotope Stages 1,5, 7, 11, and 15). Recently, orbital-scale resolution records of biogenic opal and magnetic susceptibility have been tuned to the Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) oxygen isotope stack unlocking the site’s full potential for paleoceanographic reconstructions. With the early Pliocene record, the team will test the hypothesis that the dominance of 41 kyr ice volume fluctuations observed during this interval of time is an artifact of the oxygen isotope proxy. Precession-related variations in the IRD record would support interhemispheric cancellation of the precession signal in oxygen isotope records. Dominance of obliquity would suggest that fluctuations in marine-terminating ice sheets did occur on this time scale. With the late Pleistocene interglacial intervals, which correspond to different amplitudes of obliquity versus precession in insolation forcing, investigators will examine the response of marine terminating ice margins under these different conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drop impact is a key step in applying coatings to solid surfaces and in various printing processes.  Controlling the dynamics of drop impact is essential in achieving uniform coatings and in realizing high-resolution printing.  One way to regulate drop impact is to tailor the properties of the substrate – the surface upon which drops impact.  Prior research demonstrated that soft substrates could inhibit splashing and avoid the formation of small extraneous drops.  However, the underlying physics and the role of substrate properties on drop impact are poorly understood.  This project will systematically study how variations in substrate properties influence drop impact behaviors. Conducted in collaboration with industrial engineers, the research will focus on substrates most relevant to industrial coating processes. Thus, the proposed research will enrich the fundamental understanding of drop impact dynamics and potentially revolutionize existing industrial coating practices, particularly the processes of multi-layer coating and coating on compliant surfaces.<br/><br/>The central hypothesis of this research is that precise tuning of substrate mechanical properties offers a powerful route to control drop impact outcomes with high specificity. This research will systematically investigate how compliant, heterogeneous, and non-Newtonian substrates influence drop impact dynamics. By modulating substrate elasticity to control drop impact, the research aims to reveal the missing link between the onset of splashing and the distribution of impact pressure, addressing a long-standing question in the study of drop impact.  The project will unfold in three stages, examining how (1) thin elastic substrates, (2) mechanically heterogeneous substrates, and (3) rheologically complex substrates alter the underlying fluid dynamics of drop impact. Motivated by pressing engineering challenges such as multi-layer coatings and coatings on compliant surfaces, this research will decompose complex impact scenarios into simple model processes, enabling the development of predictive understanding applicable to more complex industrial settings.

Materials discovery is often driven by complex and expensive simulation methods, typically accurate but time-intensive. The emerging machine and deep learning (MDL) models, trained on the massive simulated data collected over the past decades, offer a faster alternative. Unfortunately, these mdoels often fail to predict critical material properties, such as material stability, that the current project shall focus on. This project addresses these shortcomings of MDL models by integrating fundamental physical principles into the training of MDL models. By doing so, the models will better capture the intricate relationships between materials, leading to more reliable predictions. The project will benefit science and our society in a multitude of ways. Faster and more accurate materials discovery will accelerate innovation in clean energy, electronics, healthcare, national security, and more. The project also contributes to the advancement of artificial intelligence by introducing new techniques for constrained learning, which will impact fields beyond materials science.

To test this hypothesis and remedy this deficiency, this project will introduce a new approach to training models for materials discovery by incorporating explicit and implicit physics-informed constraints to encode the thermodynamic stability of materials with respect to phase transition and phase separation . The effect of these constraints will be assessed using existing benchmark problems and by generating additional data based on quantum mechanics to assess tailored problems in the spaces of random structure searching and fine-tuning universal machine learning interatomic potentials.

The current standard of care is very poor at diagnosing residual cancer, often times the residual cancer is not detected until it is too late to cure. Additionally, 7% of cancer patients have debilitating fear of residual cancer. Diagnosing people with residual cancer earlier will save many lives by treating the residual cancer before it spreads and can no longer be treated to cure.

Creating a cancer test, which can do both, is very difficult.  Cancer DNA in blood is very rare, as vast majority of the DNA in blood is from normal cells. This method turns a needle (cancer DNA) in a haystack (normal DNA) into a mountain of needles by blocking the normal DNA from replicating in a tube. This increases the percentage of cancer DNA, making it very easy to determine which samples have cancer DNA and which samples do not.

Polymers are essential to daily life, from technologies such as plastics to biopolymers such as DNA. A diblock copolymer is created by bonding two chemically different polymers at their ends. In most cases, different polymers do not want to mix, so they phase separate similar to the way that oil and water separate in salad dressing. In contrast, block polymers cannot phase separate because the two blocks are bonded at their ends. Rather, block polymers spontaneously undergo a process known as “self-assembly” to create an ordered structure with nanometer-sized domains that minimizes the frustration created by their inability to phase separate. These domains can have different physical properties, e.g., regularly spaced, rubbery spherical inclusions in an otherwise glassy material, creating multifunctional materials. Self-assembly occurs in a wide range of soft materials, from soaps to biomaterials, and block polymers serve as an important model system to understand the physics that drives self-assembly.<br/><br/>A long-standing goal in this area is predicting the ordered structure that will result from self-assembly based on the chemistry of the different blocks, the number of monomers in each block, and the temperature. Such a predictive ability would remove the need for tedious trial-and-error experimentation. The theory of block polymer self-assembly is remarkably powerful but suffers from a “chicken or the egg” conundrum: To perform the required calculations, one needs to know the structure that will be formed in advance. While this need poses no problems for understanding what has already been observed in experiments, it makes it extremely difficult to discover new block polymer materials via theory. This project will overcome this challenge, using generative artificial intelligence methods, similar to those that create new pictures from a library of images, to generate new possible block polymer structures by learning from a library of known structures. Machine learning will then be used to identify block polymers with appropriate chemistries and processing temperatures that will spontaneously form these new structures. <br/><br/>This project will turn the theory of block polymer self-assembly from a tool primarily used for explanation to one that can be used for exploration and, ultimately, to design new materials with novel properties. The development of these computational techniques will provide graduate and undergraduate researchers with advanced training in polymer physics and high-performance computing, contributing to the US workforce, and the computer codes developed for this work will be released to the public so that others can use them for their research. High school students will be involved in the generative artificial intelligence part of the project, developing projects for the Minnesota Science Fair and sparking their interest in pursuing materials science as a future career path.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Block polymers are amphiphilic materials created by bonding two or more different polymers at their ends. Below the order-disorder temperature, a block polymer melt selects an ordered state that balances chain stretching and interfacial tension, subject to the constraint of filling space at constant density. Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has proven to be a remarkably successful approach for understanding the block polymer thermodynamics governing order state selection. However, the non-linear governing equations in SCFT require high quality initial guesses for convergence. These computational challenges pose an obstacle when using SCFT to discover new block polymer phases. To overcome this obstacle, this project will use a generative adversarial network that learns from existing SCFT solutions to propose starting points for subsequent SCFT calculations, which are expected to converge to novel solutions. Those solutions are anticipated to be metastable states. As a result, a hierarchical computational method will be developed to efficiently solve the inverse problem of identifying block polymer formulations that stabilize those new phases. This computational workflow will be used to identify novel phases in triblock terpolymers. In addition to exhibiting a wide variety of ordered states, triblock terpolymers are synthetically tractable with fast ordering kinetics, making experimental tests of the predictions from this project realistic.<br/><br/>Block polymers are the model system for understanding self-assembly in amphiphilic soft matter owing to their relatively simple thermodynamics, and SCFT’s ability to capture those thermodynamics is a major success in soft matter theory. However, SCFT has largely been relegated to an explanatory role in block polymer self-assembly; discovery typically results from serendipitous experimentation and then theory provides a physical rationale. This project turns the paradigm on its head by developing a powerful computational approach to discover new candidate phases and then identify block polymer formulations to produce those materials. The tools developed through this research will be made available to the community as open-source software. This project will provide both graduate and undergraduate students with advanced training in polymer physics, materials science, computer science, and numerical methods. K-12 education will be enhanced through an outreach effort with the Breck School to develop projects for the Minnesota Science Fair. <br/><br/><br/>STATEMENT OF MERIT REVIEW<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, traffic control has been conducted using an aggregate approximation of the flow dynamics based on average observed driver behavior. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence allow for development of more nuanced and complex physics-informed models that can readily and quickly predict traffic behavior after observing driving behavior of individual vehicles in the flow. The development of such artificial-intelligence-guided traffic models will allow researchers and practitioners to leverage new data streams and integrate these into a framework for traffic control that is customized for specific observed traffic. Developed novel traffic control techniques intend to result in more efficient traffic control without the need for a major overhaul of our transportation infrastructure, saving investments and costs for infrastructure managers while improving traffic efficiency and reducing traffic congestion and travel time. The research, education and outreach plans are tightly integrated to further disseminate impacts through active and interactive learning opportunities that broaden participation in STEM.<br/><br/>To enable next generation traffic control that considers the dynamics of individual vehicles and their impact on the aggregate traffic flow, this research intends to (i) develop methods that rely on low-rank characterizations of time-series driving data to rapidly and reliably identify an individual vehicle driving signature, (ii) develop an artificial intelligence-guided modeling framework that relies on physics-informed learning to quickly predict the resulting aggregate traffic flow dynamics of a particular collection of vehicles with distinct driving signatures and a specified local interaction network topology, and (iii) design a suite of next-generation traffic control options including both control at fixed locations in the infrastructure, as well as control distributed throughout the flow that leverage more precise knowledge of the macroscopic dynamics to adjust control strategies based on the driving signature of individual vehicles and the anticipated resulting aggregate flow dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By combining microwave photonics (MWP) with polymer-based micro-ring resonator technology, the platform addresses current limitations in cancer diagnostics, such as high costs, slow processing times, and the bulky nature of existing systems. This innovation promises to make cancer screening more accessible, offering a portable and affordable solution for point-of-care testing. Beyond healthcare, the sensor's versatility enables applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, and other fields, delivering significant societal and economic benefits through improved efficiency and global resilience to emerging challenges.<br/><br/>This project leverages microwave photonics (MWP) and polymer-based micro-ring resonator technology to create a precise, low-cost sensor platform for detecting ctDNA in human blood. The system is designed to address the limitations of current diagnostic tools by replacing expensive tunable lasers with a microwave frequency sweep modulated on an optical carrier. This approach dramatically reduces costs while enhancing precision and scalability. Polymer micro-ring resonators are ideal for this application due to their low manufacturing cost, compatibility with biomolecule functionalization, and ability to integrate seamlessly with microfluidics for lab-on-a-chip applications. These features make the technology suitable for multiplexed analyses of biological samples. However, achieving the high optical quality factor (Q-factor) required for high sensitivity poses significant challenges due to material imperfections, such as surface roughness and optical losses in the polymer resonators. To address these issues, advanced nano-imprint fabrication techniques are employed to minimize surface roughness, improve light confinement, and enhance light-analyte interactions. Additionally, the project employs co-design methodologies that integrate the MWP readout system with the polymer resonator design, ensuring optimal sensitivity and noise performance. Functionalized resonators with DNA-specific probes will enable selective and accurate detection of ctDNA, while integrated microfluidic channels allow for multiplexed analysis of biological samples. This design can achieve detection limits as low as tens of nanograms per milliliter, enabling reliable identification of ctDNA even in trace amounts. Validation of the platform will be conducted through rigorous testing against commercial ctDNA reference materials to ensure reliability and reproducibility. Collaboration among experts in photonics, polymer manufacturing, and oncology ensures a multidisciplinary approach to addressing both technical and clinical challenges. Beyond healthcare, the versatile platform’s modularity allows for adaptation to other fields, including environmental monitoring of pollutants and detection of pathogens in agriculture. This project advances interdisciplinary research in photonics, nanofabrication, and microfluidics while providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for global challenges. By addressing critical technological barriers, such as optimizing Q-factors and employing innovative nano-imprint methods, this project not only enhances the capabilities of polymer resonator technology but also establishes a robust framework for next-generation sensing platforms.<br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-U.K. project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of United Kingdom Research and Innovation, where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and EPSRC funds the partners in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats found in certain foods such as fish and fish oil supplements. The goal of this technology is to produce a sustainable alternative to fish oils, reducing the overfishing associated with current practices. Unfortunately, the fat product produced naturally from farmed black soldier flies is suboptimal for use in animal feed and is usually disposed of as waste. This technology creates black soldier flies that can produce omega-3 fats that may be harvested and used in pet or livestock feed. This technology addresses these issues by transforming black soldier fly larvae, which are primarily used for protein production, into high-value omega-3 producers. Increasing omega-3 content in black soldier flies may create an economically attractive and environmentally sustainable alternative to fish oil.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of biomanufacturing omega-3 fatty acids in black soldier flies. Omega-3s such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are essential for human and animal health but are primarily sourced from fish oil. This technology uses genetic engineering to enhance black soldier flies to produce larvae with an altered fatty acid composition that is higher in the omega-3 precursor linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acid alpha lipoic acid (ALA). This technology is based on an automated, genetic screening processes, rapid integration of beneficial transgenes, and the creation of stable, genetically modified insect lines. Currently, black soldier flies are farmed primarily for protein production. Farming genetically enhanced black soldier flies producing omega-3 lipids may improve the value of insect farming and solve the economic challenges of insect farming through a scalable biomanufacturing platform.

Specifically, this project will examine the a ‘colloidal shunt’ mechanism, whereby a portion of the dissolved iron pool in the colloidal size range is not stabilized by complexation with organic ligands.  This iron instead forms aggregates with organic carbon to form particulate matter that sinks out of the upper water column. The research will focus on the role of dissolved organic carbon and iron-binding organic ligands in mediating the colloidal shunt, the association of organic matter with thus-formed authigenic particulate iron phases, and the dissolution of these phases in the ocean interior as a function of oxygen. Potentially transformative implications of this research are that the colloidal shunt might vary in response to climate driven changes in ocean oxygenation, and that this process may provide a conduit for the vertical export of both particulate iron and organic carbon that augments the biological carbon pump in the subtropical and tropical oceans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variation in how selective females are, termed choosiness, is common. Choosiness shapes which males' genes enter the next generation and plays a key role in speciation. However, despite its central role in numerous evolutionary processes, basic questions about variation in choosiness and its genomic basis remain poorly understood. Using crickets as a study system, this project aims to examine whether females differ reliably in their choosiness for male song and how much of those differences among females reflect their genetics. Using gene expression and genetic mapping experiments, this project also aims to identify candidate genes underlying variation in choosiness. One of the broader impacts of this project explore the use of alternative tools (dance) for teaching animal behavior to college and K-12 students as a complement to typical written and spoken approaches.<br/><br/>Choosiness describes how discerning an individual is in mate choice, and the dramatic differences animals demonstrate in choosiness has major implications for selection and speciation. Yet our understanding about variation in choosiness remains poor compared to our understanding of which traits are favored. This imbalance hinders our ability to answer crucial questions about individual differences and whether reinforcement selection could impact choosiness. This project focuses on crickets, in which pulse rate of the male song and female preference for pulse rate are species-specific and under natural selection. The proposed work will estimate intraspecific variation in choosiness for song pulse rate, examine whether there is repeatable individual variation in choosiness, and understand its relationship with variation in other preference traits.

Biofilms are groups of bacteria that stick together via secreted polymers and can be found on many surfaces—from rocks in streams to medical devices. While sometimes beneficial, biofilms often cause problems in industrial and medical settings because they are hard to remove and resist antibiotics. Understanding how bacteria interact with biofilms and switch between swimming/non-swimming states is crucial for controlling harmful biofilms. However, studying these interactions has been challenging due to the lack of tools that can observe both types of bacteria simultaneously. This project aims to develop HoloCon, a new imaging tool that combines three-dimensional holographic imaging and fluorescent microscopy, allowing scientists to see both free-swimming bacteria and biofilms in three dimensions and observe their interactions in real time at the single-cell level. HoloCon will visualize and quantify both bacterial populations in one setup, explaining how resident biofilms repel free-swimming cells attempting to colonize and invade them—a common scenario in natural environments like the ocean. HoloCon will be widely useful to researchers observing cell dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and to others imaging cell or particle trajectories in complex three-dimensional environments such as tissues. The Broader Impacts of the project include its intrinsic merit as the project could impact the work of microbiologists, cell biologists, and developmental biologists. Research tasks will be integrated with educational missions to train future scientists and engineers and inspire public interest through classes, research, and outreach activities in high schools.<br/><br/>The major goal of the proposal includes both the development of a new tool for cell biology studies and the scientific discoveries enabled by the new tool. Specifically, in Aim 1, an innovative imaging tool named HoloCon will be developed, which represents the first system capable of simultaneously capturing 3D images of rapidly swimming bacteria and monitoring the dynamic evolution of biofilm architecture at single-cell level. HoloCon is composed of three integrated modules: a real-time 3D particle tracking module based on digital in-line holography (DIH) integrated with machine learning, a customized spinning disk confocal microscope module that receives information from DIH, and a fully integrated data analysis module ready for the research community to use. Aim 2 centers on addressing the key scientific questions of how resident biofilms repel free-swimming cells attempting to colonize and invade the biofilm.

Scissors congruence originated in Hilbert's 3rd Problem, which asks when two polyhedra in three-dimensional space are ""scissors congruent,"" meaning one can be obtained from the other by cutting it into smaller polyhedra and reassembling in a different way.  This question, together with its solution by Dehn, initiated an extensive program of research. Over the past 120 years these ideas have grown and now connect to almost every branch of geometry. Ground-breaking recent work provides a fundamental link between this program and algebraic K-theory, which is itself a deep and rapidly developing area of research.  Algebraic K-theory intertwines three major fields of mathematics: topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. Developing the connection between scissors congruence and algebraic K-theory will significantly advance research in both.  This work also provides the platform for striking new research avenues that will bring to bear the tools and techniques of modern algebraic K-theory research on a wide range of geometric questions.  This project additionally includes a number of efforts to support students and new researchers in the field, expanding and broadening access to these innovative ideas.<br/><br/><br/>This broad new program of research develops the foundations of combinatorial, or ""cut-and-paste,"" algebraic K-theory, applies these new tools to resolve outstanding geometric questions, and expands the scope of combinatorial K-theory to new applications.  It brings modern techniques in algebraic K-theory to the emerging K-theoretic approach to cut-and-paste invariants, and applies this approach to a variety of problems in algebraic topology, differential topology, and algebraic geometry. Algebraic K-theory has seen a stunning revolution in the last thirty years due to the invention of trace methods, but these tools have not yet been developed for combinatorial K-theory, a deficiency that this project hopes to remedy. This requires developing the foundations of this new theory and exploiting connections to equivariant homotopy theory.  New computational and analytic tools for combinatorial K-theory will lead to progress on a wide variety of geometric problems, including applications to manifolds and invertible TQFTs, varieties and motivic measures, and fixed point theory.  Many questions in these fields have natural interpretations in terms of cut-and-paste invariants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogels are used for wound healing, drug delivery in the body, and even<br/>to clean up pollution. Made from long chains of molecules called polymers, hydrogels hold large<br/>amounts of water and change shape or function depending on their design. However, designing<br/>the most effective hydrogels for specific applications is a complex challenge. Traditional testing<br/>methods are slow and expensive, making it difficult for researchers to quickly and efficiently<br/>identify the best hydrogels. This prevents effective hydrogel materials from being developed for<br/>many critical applications.<br/>This proposal aims to leverage two innovative techniques, barcoding and pooled<br/>screening, to accelerate the testing and development of hydrogels. The principal investigator<br/>proposes to barcode individual hydrogel materials with unique identifiers, like product barcodes<br/>in a store. These barcodes are chemical markers that can be used to track and distinguish<br/>hydrogels. Instead of testing each hydrogel separately, barcoded hydrogels can be grouped, or<br/>pooled, together and exposed to the same test conditions, saving time and resources and<br/>lowering experimental variability. The barcodes make it possible to track the performance of each<br/>hydrogel individually. This proposed method will provide a way to test up to hundreds or thousands<br/>of hydrogel designs in parallel, enabling rapid evaluation and comparison of hydrogel<br/>performance. This approach aims to speed up the discovery of improved, functional hydrogels for<br/>medical and environmental applications.<br/>This project will also give middle school students the opportunity to learn about hydrogels<br/>through hands-on demos.

However, their complex<br/>design and vast parameter space make it challenging to identify generalizable design principles<br/>through traditional, low-throughput methods, slowing and preventing the development of<br/>functional hydrogel materials. High-throughput techniques like barcoding and pooled screening<br/>can accelerate the discovery of structure-function relationships. While these types of approaches<br/>have not yet been applied to hydrogel-based biomaterials, there is significant potential to advance<br/>this field to the same extent. This CAREER proposal aims to leverage a molecular barcoding<br/>platform pioneered by the principal investigator for systematic evaluation of hydrogel parameters<br/>in a pooled, combinatorial manner. This approach will enable the assessment of material<br/>properties such as degradation and cargo release and help establish generalizable design rules<br/>for diverse hydrogel systems. By utilizing cost-effective, commercially available barcoding<br/>reagents and mass spectrometry-based detection methods, the proposed approach offers a<br/>standardized, high-throughput tool accessible to the hydrogel community. Additionally, it will<br/>streamline data harmonization and automate workflows. The research focuses on four main<br/>areas: (1) examining how polymer and linker designs affect hydrogel degradation, (2) studying<br/>the impact of biomolecule size and charge on release from hydrogel matrices, (3) developing and<br/>characterizing hydrogel sorbents, and (4) automating screening workflows.

This technology is designed for the person who lives with post-amputation pain, a growing population worldwide due to trauma or vascular disease (e.g., diabetes, peripheral vascular disease). People experience a range of pain following amputation, including residual limb pain (i.e., pain felt in the remaining limb) and phantom limb pain (i.e., pain felt in the part of the limb that no longer remains). Phantom limb pain affects up to 86% of individuals with amputation and results in added health care expenses in the first year following amputation. In addition to being prevalent, amputation-related pain is associated with poorer health outcomes, interference with life activities, anxiety, and depression. While many treatments exist, success rates with treatments vary, and it is not clear how to optimize treatment prescription. Long-term, the application of the pain assessment and intervention recommender technology can include other chronic pain populations such as chronic low back pain or fibromyalgia, thereby expanding the commercial potential of this project.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of a pain assessment and intervention recommender technology. Current standards for assessing pain involve patient reports during a clinic appointment. However, these reports can be affected by recall bias and the clinic environment. This technology enables the patient to have a real-time assessment that occurs in their home environment. The assessment can be performed virtually, which has the potential to improve care for all patients regardless of their proximity to services. The results are processed through a recommender platform that uses machine learning algorithms to generate a personalized recommendation for intervention. The goal of the recommended intervention is to increase the patient's ability to participate in desired roles and activities through effective pain treatment. The pain assessment and intervention recommender has the potential to guide more effective treatment recommendations, reduce clinical follow-up visits, and improve accessibility for patients in rural areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The computations in a chip are facilitated by supply voltages that are distributed to the computational elements through power distribution networks (PDNs).  These PDNs consist of structures that carry large currents through lossy filamentous wires, which may be inadequate for ensuring robust voltage levels at the computational elements. These effects can potentially lead to incorrect computations and unacceptable errors. Moreover, high currents can cause accelerated aging in the PDN due to phenomena such as electromigration (EM) that can result in chip failure. Developing optimization strategies that ensure supply voltage integrity and PDN reliability is therefore critical. The task is further complicated with the challenges associated with emerging methods for building advanced integrated circuits, including new wire and transistor structures, and elevated on-chip currents and temperatures that degrade performance and reliability. Therefore, the development of PDN design techniques is vital for enabling the next generation of chips that drive computation from the datacenter to the edge.<br/><br/>This project aims to address the challenges of optimizing voltage drop and EM in PDNs, while ensuring minimal utilization of the limited available on-chip wiring resources. For the problem of voltage drop, the work will address today’s widely used front-side interconnects as well as newer backside interconnect technologies. Degradations in supply voltages can also cause circuit delays to deteriorate: the interplay of PDN optimization on circuit timing in digital circuits will be addressed in this project through new approaches that break down the barrier between PDN design and timing optimization, performing integrated optimizations that benefit both PDN resource usage and logic circuit metrics. To address EM, this research will advance the use of physics-based approaches that predict chip lifetimes by directly modeling EM-induced stress in interconnects. New methods will be developed based on a stress-electrical duality that maps accurate physics-based stress analysis to methods for analyzing resistor-capacitor (RC) networks and transmission lines.

The advanced skills needed in rural Minnesota are broader than those needed in metropolitan regions, with the expectation that technicians are both able to manually navigate older equipment that is still being serviced at local shops as well as those in production at mines or other resource-related industries, such as logging. However, the growing need for skills that match an emerging market of “electric diesel” equipment and other high-powered and highly networked equipment is increasing. To address the demand for upskilling, Minnesota North College will create an advanced diagnostics transportation micro-credential to build the immediate skills needed for new technicians to successfully transition to more sophisticated advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), hybrid and electric components testing, and networking. The proposed project will be designed to quickly develop students' skills and knowledge to align with industry needs through a five-course micro-credential. Courses will be available for second-year diesel mechanics and automotive technician students and field technicians. Over this three-year project, 12 students in two cohorts will be recruited to complete the certificate program. Based on the demographics of the region and college, and the comprehensive support services offered through college, a highly skilled diverse automotive and diesel workforce for the region will emerge. <br/><br/>This project aims to increase access to advanced diagnostic skills to supplement the after-market automotive sector, private contractor, and mining workforce in heavy equipment. The goal of the project is to upskill current and new cohorts of rural transportation technicians in advanced driver-assistance systems and advanced diagnostics with an emphasis on the recruitment of adult learners and women. Representatives from the diesel and automotive industries will serve on an advisory board to provide insight into the development of the advanced diagnostics micro-credential certificate program. Additionally, college faculty will participate in relevant professional development to build curriculum that aligns with diagnostic, autonomous, and comprehensive advanced vehicle maintenance. The resulting four-month certificate program will provide an accelerated training option for students and industry professionals to be better prepared to meet regional transportation needs. This project will create the first workforce in northeastern Minnesota that will be equipped to navigate greater levels of troubleshooting and diagnostic repair on increasingly connected vehicles in the automotive and heavy equipment sector.

Optimization is crucial in engineering applications involving components that are expected to execute complex mechanical operations, such as aerospace systems, biomedical devices and soft robotics. Together with the fabrication flexibility in additive manufacturing, optimization boosts the opportunities for design by tapping into a nearly unbounded design space.  This award supports research with the goal to design structures that can be programmed to display variable levels of material softness and rigidity, allowing them to manage, intelligently, the loads applied by the outside environment. The advances enabled by this study will affect many technological applications of industrial and societal interest, such as the design of tires space vehicles or operating in hazardous environments, protective equipment that can sustain impacts from projectiles, and soft robotic devices with sensing capabilities. The knowledge will enrich understanding of important concepts in mechanics and optimization, with educational impact on how these topics are taught in the classroom.<br/><br/>Topological metamaterials are systems whose functionalities are controlled and protected by the topology of their phonon bands. They display unconventional elasticity regimes characterized by robustness against defects, damage and randomness. This project is especially concerned with so-called topological polarization, a property of certain lattice materials that manifests as a dichotomy between edges, whereby one edge displays an excess of softness, promoting extreme localization of deformation, while the opposite edge behaves rigidly. This property enables the design of materials with soft boundaries that can handle asperities and sharp loads, without compromising the global stiffness of the entire structure. The project will investigate polarization through the lens of optimization with a double objective: acquiring a deeper understanding of the mechanistic relations between the geometric features of the materials and the emergent polarization, and designing families of metamaterials with maximized and programmable polarization, beyond the canonical kagome paradigm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Instead of just copying actions, this approach allows us to capture both the agent’s goals (preferences) and how it understands the world (environment dynamics). This provides a much deeper insight into behavior, enabling predictions about how the agent would act in new or unseen situations. Such models are valuable because they can help improve decision-making systems, allowing them to adapt and make reliable choices in complex real-world scenarios, such as personalized AI assistants, autonomous systems, or decision support tools. There is an urgent need for models and algorithms that can create such structural frameworks. The outcomes of this project will have broad applications, including areas like control systems, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Moreover, these efforts offer valuable opportunities to enhance the optimization and reinforcement learning curriculum, engaging students from diverse backgrounds in cross-disciplinary research and K12 outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>This project develops machine learning models of an agent’s dynamic decisions subject to structural constraints on observed behavior. Specifically, the agent’s observed behavior (data) is modeled as being consistent with the inter-temporal optimization of a reward function (preferences) given a representation of how the environment evolves pursuant to control actions (dynamics). Unlike behavioral cloning models, a structural model of observed control behavior is a solid basis to perform counterfactual analysis and/or transfer learning. However, developing structural models of control is computationally challenging and the statistical properties of structural estimators are not easy to characterize. This project aims to advance the state-of-the-art on methodologies for learning structural models of control, by considering a diverse set of data (including demonstration and preferences), and by considering both online and offline settings. Finally, extensive experiments will be conducted to evaluate and apply the proposed methodologies in aligning large language models (LLMs), and in autonomous driving.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GPCRs are a large family of cell surface receptors that play a crucial role in transmitting signals from the outside to the inside of cells. These receptors are among the most important drug targets in modern medicine, with many medications, including beta-blockers, antihistamines, and psychiatric drugs, interacting with specific GPCRs. Nearly one-third of all FDA-approved drugs target GPCRs, representing approximately 30% ($890 billion) of the global pharmaceutical market share.  GPCRs are desirable drug targets for two main reasons: their druggable sites are easily accessible, and they directly regulate a wide range of physiological and disease processes. However, conventional GPCR-targeted drugs face limitations in terms of safety and efficacy, restricting the patient populations they can effectively treat. This project proposes a novel drug discovery platform targeting this new GCPR druggable site that could overcome these limitations, enabling the identification of new drug candidates and the development of more effective, safer, and innovative therapies more rapidly.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the proposed technology.

Compared to other druggable sites on GPCRs, this site is highly specific in terms of its composition among the 800+ different receptor isoforms. The technology that was developed in the process of characterizing this new site is a platform that enables identification of compounds that target this site. A key component of this platform is a patented high-throughput screening assay that detects nuanced differences in GPCR drug effectiveness that are not detectable using other high-throughput screening formats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Families with children with neuromuscular conditions will similarly benefit. This novel wheelchair reduces the number of pieces of specialized equipment needed in the school or at home, reducing both cost and space demands as well as reducing the number of staff members/caregivers and time needed to assist the children in transitioning between and using each piece of equipment. Finally, a pediatric manual mobile standing wheelchair may have significant health benefits for children with neuromuscular conditions including the health benefits from frequent standing (bone density, muscle and tendon length, respiratory and cardiovascular health, and more) and the psychosocial benefit of increased independence and participation. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology.

The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. This connection allows a two-way flow of information, with algebraic invariants distinguishing spaces and topological methods informing algebraic problems. Starting from foundational work of Quillen, algebraic and algebraic geometry data like formal groups gives rise to new invariants for spaces with striking properties. This project combines this classical thread with much more recent developments coming from equivariant algebraic topology. ""Equivariant algebraic topology"" remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. This extra structure provides more nuanced computations, giving more information about how the classically described invariants change under symmetries. Equivariant algebraic topology has experienced a renaissance recently due to the solution by the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel to the Kervaire Invariant One problem, one of the oldest outstanding problems in algebraic topology. The solution introduced a host of new constructions and techniques that have striking ramifications in classical and equivariant algebraic topology, and this project focuses on unpacking some of these new constructions, exploring their ramifications in classically studied computations, and describing what they mean for algebraic topology in general. Many of the projects focus on diversity in STEM. Building on the PI's prior First Year seminar on Women in Math, the PI will create a diversity-driven class, combining mathematical content and pedagogy with discussions of representation and inclusion in mathematics. At the same time, the PI intends to create more opportunities for students who do not see themselves as ""math people"" to connect with algebra and geometry concepts using UCLA's ""Maker Spaces"" to have students design and build concrete models. The PI will continue conference organizing, especially conferences focusing on making space for early career mathematicians and for advanced undergraduates, using these as a way to connect students with the ideas and researchers in stable homotopy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using newly developed tools in equivariant stable homotopy, the PI will study the slice spectral sequences for certain chromatically meaningful quotients of hyperreal spectra. These are closely connected to the classical approaches to studying K(n)-local phenomena using the Hopkins--Miller higher real K-theory spectra, and at the prime 2, computations here subsume all previously known higher real K-theory computations. The project focuses mainly on concrete computations (both of chromatically meaningful quotients of hyperreal bordism and of more traditional objects like the dual Steenrod algebra), while also studying more abstract questions of what kinds of multiplicative structures we can see. Finally, an application of all of this machinery to the classical questions of orientability of vector bundles is explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project’s novelties are to develop a shared computational resource for pathology research based on the combined experience of the investigators in the Division of Computational Pathology and AI within DLMP and the ongoing data collection activities. Upon completion, this project will drive the advancement of knowledge throughout healthcare, leading to innovative breakthroughs that benefit both academia and the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>Although our group contributes to the clinical application of AI in DLMP, the research itself cannot and should not be solely driven by the specific clinical needs of the department, and therefore we must augment existing strategies with the computational instrumentation needed to establish research capabilities around our rapidly growing data sets. The project involves utilizing an existing environment at Mayo to install GPU- and CPU-based computational servers dedicated to the proposed work and connected to the rapidly growing clinical data store. Local data storage for rapid computational processing is also part of the funded computational environment, and together will support data reuse, data exploration, and modern machine learning strategies to streamline data annotation and labeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a critical need for the development of a core group of leaders to enact sustainable change that will enhance these connections. This project will facilitate and evaluate a virtual, multi-day workshop with a focus on leadership development that will include teams of two-year college faculty and disciplinary society representatives. Eleven disciplines will participate. The first part of the workshop will include sessions on specific leadership skills and planning for participant-led outreach activities to put those skills into practice, with opportunities for cross-discipline sharing. These outreach activities for their two-year college and disciplinary society colleagues will include workshops offered at their campus, in their region, and at disciplinary society conferences as well as individual meetings with administrators. Building on their disciplinary action plans, the outreach activities will engage people beyond the workshop participants and communicate the benefits of two-year college engagement with societies. In the last part of the workshop, participants will report on their outreach activities and discuss next steps. The leadership capacities gained and practiced in this workshop will contribute to the broader STEM enterprise by empowering the participants to be agents of change on campus, in their disciplinary societies, and in cross-disciplinary efforts. <br/><br/>The project will foster engagement between two-year colleges and disciplinary societies, strengthen connections between two-year college faculty and their disciplinary communities, and support sharing of effective strategies across multiple disciplines and disciplinary societies. The workshop goals are to (1) provide leadership development that supports participants in advancing in leadership roles needed to promote two-year-college and disciplinary society collaborative efforts; (2) support participants in leading outreach activities that build on disciplinary action plans and communicate the benefits of two-year college-disciplinary society engagement; (3) build networks and communities of participants within and across disciplines; and (4) investigate the impact of this leadership development in moving collaborations between two-year colleges and disciplinary societies forward. This project will advance knowledge of effective strategies for enhancing collaborations between two-year colleges and disciplinary societies through an analysis of the outreach activities led by participants. This project will also advance knowledge of how the workshop influenced participant leadership development and confidence using pre- and post-surveys. A workshop report will be distributed to all participants and disciplinary societies and will be available to all in the professional and academic scientific community on the workshop website.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity since they are among the most natural ways to represent the fundamental objects in the EDA flow. However, with increased design complexity and chip capacity, an increasing performance gap exists between the extremely large graphs in EDA and the insufficient support from general-purpose hardware, such as mainstream graphics processing units (GPUs). This project aims to expedite the large graph machine learning on various EDA tasks, through a full-fledged development of efficient and scalable computing paradigms. This project's novelties are EDA domain knowledge-aware graph machine learning, training acceleration, and algorithm-hardware co-design and optimization. The project's broader significance and importance include: (1) to advance the field of machine learning in chip design, highlighted in National Artificial Intelligence Initiative; (2) to deepen the understanding of interactions among EDA domain knowledge, graph learning, and GPU acceleration; (3) to enrich the computer engineering curriculum and promote participation from undergraduates, underrepresented groups, and K-12 students in STEM fields through relevant programs.<br/><br/>The project will develop a design paradigm for efficient, scalable and practical algorithm-hardware co-optimized solutions to significantly accelerate large graph machine learning on EDA tasks using a single GPU.

Over the past six years, the number of contributors uploading data more than tripled and MagIC usage and dataset downloads increased more than sixfold. These large increases in contributors, contributions, and data usage are possible because of a community-driven unified MagIC data model and because the MagIC Facility deploys highly scalable databases and a highly adaptable web interface. Although there is still a noticeable sparsity of data on the internet that can be characterized as being easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—these FAIR data principles lie at the heart of MagIC. In addition, training of the next generation of researchers and members of underrepresented groups in the development and use of modern data analysis methods form another central component in the MagIC Facility. In the next three years, the MagIC Facility will focus its efforts on making enhancements to ensure efficient access to data in a wide range of subdomain science disciplines, transparency in data processing, and reliable documentation—altogether to allow questions of reproducibility and standardization to be readily addressed by researcher and student users. <br/><br/>The MagIC Facility will develop several novel geoinformatics products including an Integrated Contribution Development Environment using template notebooks on https://jupyterhub.earthref.org with guided steps for programmatically editing, visualizing, reproducing data analysis results, and updating user contributions without leaving the browser; two specialized Subdomain Views with featured filters, relevant data summaries, and subdomain-specific calculations and visualizations; a Dataset Enrichment tool to further reduce efforts to prepare an online data contribution for publication; and Superuser Private Workspaces to support large facility and laboratory data management needs within MagIC.

Modern AI requires large datacenters that house thousands of specialized computers that are used to train AI models and generate responses to queries. These datacenters require huge amounts of electricity, and they generate so much heat that extensive cooling systems are needed to prevent the computers from overheating. Networks of datacenters already exist to support the cloud-based computing that the world has come to rely on for everything from communication to banking to transportation infrastructure. However, the growth of AI will dramatically increase the need for such datacenters. According to a 2024 report from the International Energy Agency, an AI-enabled ChatGPT query uses almost ten times more energy than a standard Google search. Furthermore, the report predicts exponential growth in the AI industry, increasing AI’s electricity demand by at least 10x from 2023 to 2026. This research project will investigate ways to fundamentally redesign the computing systems that support AI, from the semiconductor materials and devices to the computing circuits and architectures. The project aims to improve the energy efficiency of these systems by orders of magnitude. Such dramatic reductions in the energy demand for AI would positively impact society by reducing the strain on the electricity grid and mitigating the impacts of AI on climate change. Furthermore, this project supports an Education and Workforce Development plan that is a collaboration with community colleges and the Micro Nano Technology Education Center, an NSF Advanced Technology Education Center dedicated to increasing the semiconductor workforce. <br/><br/><br/>In this project, a team of investigators will pursue interdisciplinary research encompassing materials, devices, circuits, and architecture co-designs to improve the energy efficiency of AI and machine learning computing hardware. Most of the computing resources for machine learning algorithms are used by multiply-and-accumulate (MAC). The regularity and parallelism of MACs make them very suitable for hardware acceleration. However, conventional random-access memory requires row-by-row accesses, and fetching billions of weights in this manner consumes substantial energy. One solution to this bottleneck is eliminating the row-by-row memory access by designing hardware systems where the computing occurs inside the memory, referred to as “in-memory computing”. In-memory computing is achieved by inserting a small computing circuit in each memory cell. A promising new memory element, the “memcapacitor,” has been proposed for this purpose, but few devices have been experimentally demonstrated. The technical aims of this project can be broken into three major areas: 1) Create a vertical memcapacitor device that can be fabricated in the backend of the CMOS process for monolithic 3D integration; 2) Create memcapacitor-based in-memory computing circuits; and 3) Create a deep neural network accelerator with fully analog-datapath and digital-control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased erosion and sediment yield from these events is likely to damage soils, clog rivers, and cripple hydraulic infrastructure. However, we have little information on the magnitude of the response of our rivers and landscapes to global climate change because these changes occur on timescales difficult to measure in our lifetimes. Therefore, we must look to times in Earth’s past when temperatures and atmospheric CO¬2 concentrations rose rapidly to study landscape response. During the early Eocene, approximately 56 to 52 million years ago, there were repeated intervals known as hyperthermal events where global temperatures rapidly increased due to releases of CO2 over a period of ~20,000 years. These hyperthermals provide one of the best analogs to modern anthropogenic climate change, albeit at a slower rate than today. This project will focus on improving scientific and public understanding of how future climate change will affect our river systems by using analogs from the early Eocene in New Mexico, Wyoming, and North Dakota. The education plan will target a diverse population of students from the University of Houston that will strengthen undergraduate exposure to field geology using virtual field trips. Because climate change can be an abstract and intimidating concept for some groups, collaborations with a world-renowned climate-artist will be used to break down mental barriers and communicate science to the public and low-income and minority students from the Houston area. <br/><br/>This project will generate new terrestrial paleoclimate records from three fluvially dominated basins in the western US: 1) San Juan Basin of New Mexico, 2) Wind River Basin of Wyoming, and 3) Williston Basin of North Dakota.

The resulting dataset will be integrated into quantitative models to test how rapid atmospheric CO2 increases, global warming, and the resulting hydrologic cycle intensification will increase the magnitude of weathering and sediment yield, which has the potential to cause billions of dollars in damage to infrastructure and ecosystems from soil loss, erosion, and increased flooding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This raises questions of how the brain regulates sustained grasp force and processes sensory input from different parts of the hand. This project will investigate cortical oscillations using high-density electrode grids while human subjects perform sustained hand grasp tasks and feel tactile stimuli such as touch and vibration. Novel computational algorithms will be developed and applied to the neural data to predict the produced grasp force and differentiate tactile inputs to the hand. This project will provide novel knowledge regarding the organization of sensorimotor cortex activity in relation to grasp force and tactile sensations. Brain regions that show unique activity in response to touch and vibration will then be stimulated with electrical pulses to elicit artificial sensations. Insights gained from this project will play a critical role in the development of closed-loop neuroprosthetics that can replicate natural hand function.<br/><br/>Despite considerable progress regarding our understanding of the neural bases of sensorimotor behavior, there is very limited knowledge about the neural dynamics of sensory and motor cortical circuits during the generation of sustained complex hand function, such as grasping and tactile exploration, which are essential for common daily activities. A better understanding of the spatio-temporal neural dynamics associated with sustained complex hand movements and somatosensory processing is a necessary requirement for the construction of more efficient closed-loop neuroprosthetics. Utilizing advanced electrode technology, this project will record cortical activity with high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) grids, then decode multichannel data with computational intelligence for the identification of oscillatory patterns of the sensorimotor cortex during the execution of sustained hand grasp function. The high-density ECoG grids will provide recordings of brain activity across a large cortical space and with sub-centimeter resolution. Simultaneously, tactile sensory inputs--such as vibration and touch--will be delivered to different fingers and palm. The project will examine to what extent the cortical oscillations can be used to predict the produced grasp force and distinguish between different prolonged somatosensory inputs to the hand. The project will also develop a real-time system for the mapping cortical activations online, then stimulate cortical regions using channel suites and temporal patterns mimicking the ECoG modulations using a computer-in-the-loop system. The project will integrate neuroscience, neurosurgery and biomedical engineering expertise, to uncover spatio-spectral dynamics of somatosensory and motor cortical oscillations, and decode these patterns for the control of closed-loop hand neuroprosthetics.

One promising direction is showing what the machine “thought” was anomalous within a given image to volunteers for further inspection. Additional benefits of this project include engaging nearly 3 million members of the public who participate in citizen science through Zooniverse and giving them the opportunity to learn more about how machine learning really works, engaging young women in University of Minnesota computer science coding camps, and providing capstone projects for Data Science Masters program students to engage in real-world research while preparing them for careers in data science. <br/><br/>Taking advantage of the exceptionally large labeled datasets available through Zooniverse projects and the fact that the majority of Zooniverse projects are image-based, the research effort will investigate training and deploying Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, the impact of combining human and machine attention and anomaly detectors on a real-world citizen science platform will be explored with the two objectives: (1) Classification Efficiency Studies  to optimize the classification efficiency of known-known classes, including sparsely represented classes,  across multiple domains and task types; and (2) Systematized Serendipity Studies to increase the efficiency of detecting diverse, scientifically interesting anomalies beyond the usual statistically inferred ones. Both objectives will be carried out through experiments implemented on Correct-a-Machine infrastructure which will enable machine proposals as well as machine attention and anomaly maps to be displayed to volunteers. A Leveling-up Strategy for Volunteers infrastructure will also be deployed to enable a human-driven approach to anomaly detection. The research team will carry out experiments that include simply testing improved classification efficiency with humans correcting implicit machine attention (i.e., are models such as vision transformers just significantly better at object detection and therefore the efficiency gains when coupled in a human-machine system are worth the complexity of implementation and training) through to more complex experiments that explicitly combine machine and human attention (that is, does asking volunteers to correct an explicit machine attention map improve performance of the machine or further, can machine attention and anomaly maps aid in human identification of anomalies in the data?). The test projects implemented through this work will be immediately scientifically useful, but importantly will also underpin the human-machine infrastructure required to enable multiple research disciplines to make best use of the ever-increasing amounts of data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dynamics underscore the demand for innovation and effective teaching methods catering to a new generation of learners while ensuring the transfer of knowledge and skills from experienced technicians. Traditional educational methodologies and digital tools struggle to stay apace of industry, and may fail to provide the immersive, hands-on experience central for preparing the next generation of technicians. X-Reality (XR), which includes Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR and VR), has the potential to reshape the approach technician education. This collaborative project (KonnectXR) will develop an enterprise-level platform optimized for educational systems and make it available to educators across the nation. <br/><br/>KonnectXR will bridge connecting traditional learning management systems (LMS) with the immersive world of XR. By incorporating Single-Sign On (SSO) capabilities, the platform will allow instructors and students to transition smoothly between their learning management system (LMS) and individual or collaborative XR environments and will mimic moving between classrooms and labs in a physical school. A focus on Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)-compliant encryption will address the critical need for data security in an increasingly digital educational sphere. The project goals address the need to improve technician education through accelerated integration of XR technology into the technician classroom. Four goals guide the project team. First, is to integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities with FERPA-compliant encryption that implements Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) protocol 1.3 to enable seamless LMS interoperability, with testing against Blackboard, Canvas, and D2L Brightspace. Second, is to develop and validate a multi-user networking framework to support at least 50 simultaneous users with sub-25ms latency. Third, is to create and implement six XR lab experiences in four ATE domains that incorporate Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles, plus six accompanying tutorials and associated instructor implementation resources. Fourth, is to conduct user experience research studies with 30 instructors and 100 students to analyze effectiveness and refine the design to maximize accessibility and adoption.

For example, the clients either need to share their sensitive data, such as healthcare records, financial information, with the server, or the server has to disclose the model to the clients. To guarantee privacy, the rise of cryptographic protocols, such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), enable ML analytics directly on the encrypted data. While enticing, there still exists a big gap between the theory and practice, e.g., long latency due to the prohibitively expensive computation or communication overhead over ciphertext. This project aims to practically accelerate the private ML service by offering a full-fledged development of efficient, scalable and encryption-conscious computing paradigms. The project's novelties lie in new ML-specific cryptographic operators, accuracy-preserving and crypto-friendly neural architectures, and pioneered algorithm-hardware co-design methodologies. The project's broader significance and importance are: (1) to advance trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), one of the national strategic pillars of the National AI Initiative; (2) to deepen the understanding of interactions among cryptography, machine learning and hardware acceleration; (3) to enrich the computer engineering curriculum, and the training of students from diverse backgrounds through relevant programs at Lehigh University, Northeastern University, and the University of Connecticut.<br/><br/>The project will develop a multifaceted design paradigm for efficient, scalable and practical algorithm-hardware co-optimized solutions to significantly accelerate privacy-preserving machine learning on hardware platforms such as FPGA.

Faculty advisors play a core role in the experiences of science graduate students in the United States. They often have significant control over a student’s stipend, workspace, resources, research project, collaborators and, ultimately, time to graduate. The influential position of the advisor makes the choice of advisor pivotal to graduate students’ progress. This project contributes to knowledge about factors affecting graduate student success by investigating the methods used to pair graduate students with an advisor and the impact those methods may have on graduate students’ sense of belonging, intent to persist in their programs, and satisfaction with their advisors. The researchers will explore the experiences of administrators, faculty, and students with the practices and policies of various recruitment methods to identify what pre-existing elements should be removed or modified.<br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the experiences of three stakeholder groups (graduate students, faculty advisors, and graduate program coordinators) with different graduate student recruitment methods (e.g., rotations and direct admission) into life sciences, chemistry, and physics. To achieve this goal, the researchers will carry out four interconnected aims. They will use a national survey of graduate students to test the hypothesis that the method of recruitment impacts students’ experiences with their advisors, interest in completing their graduate training and their sense of belonging to their research group and their program. Interviews with three stakeholder groups will be used to fulfill the three remaining aims. Interviews with faculty advisors will provide insights into how different recruitment methods impact their decisions on which students to accept. Graduate program coordinator interviews will provide information about how recruitment methods are implemented in their programs, the challenges with these approaches, and the reasons why a program uses a particular recruitment method or methods. Finally, interviews with graduate students who switched labs will reveal how students navigate program policies about changing advisors and the effect of recruitment methods on this process. Combined, these stakeholder perspectives will reveal affordances and constraints of different recruitment methods allowing for suggestions about policy recommendations and best practices.

Research indicates that rather than emphasizing the diversity of strategies and experiences that organisms have around sex, gender, and orientation, biology courses often inaccurately categorize sex and gender as binary. The oversimplification of sex and gender into binary categories can make biology classrooms particularly challenging for TNG students. Early data suggest that how sex and gender topics are represented in the biology curriculum impacts TNG students’ sense of belonging and interest in biology. Understanding TNG students’ experiences with biology content will support the design of interventions and curriculum inclusive of both TNG and intersex students. This project will also help all biology students develop inclusive and scientifically accurate understandings of sex and gender.  Finally, this work will positively impact the career competencies of all biology majors who will need skills and knowledge to work with diverse patients, stakeholders, and teams.  <br/><br/>Guided by master narrative theory, the goals of this project are to: 1) explore how sex and gender are currently represented in the undergraduate biology content, 2) describe the impact this content has on classroom climate and belonging for TNG students, and 3) characterize the current efforts of biology instructors to create a more inclusive climate for TNG students. Master narrative theory deciphers how messages in the cultural environment become internalized and impact the development of personal identity. The sample will include TNG students with diverse racial/ethnic and social identities along with biology instructors recruited from a variety of institutions. Data collected will include participant interviews (recorded and transcribed), participant baseline demographic surveys, course observations (e.g., video recordings), and course artifacts (e.g., lesson plan, assessment questions). Feminist phenomenology, qualitative content analysis, and document analysis will be used to analyze the data.

These simulations will determine the optimal nitrogen fertilizer application rates based on field characteristics, rainfall, and growing conditions. Harvest data from the small plots will validate that the expected benefits are delivered to farmers. Over 10% of the energy consumed in the U.S. agricultural sector is used for producing nitrogen fertilizer for corn. By enabling United States corn farmers to optimize nitrogen fertilizer use, this technology will improve the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer application, thus reducing the energy intensity and carbon footprint of U.S. agriculture.

The topic of the workshop addresses an area, crystal growth, that has been identified by the National Research Council as strategically important and in need of strengthening in the U.S.  Advances in this area will impact advanced manufacturing processes that affect electronic and photonic devices for information, energy, defense, and detector systems, the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and more. Improvements in these crystal-base systems will favorably impact wide-ranging domains relevant to national prosperity, defense, and health.<br/><br/>In addition to promoting discourse and collaboration among researchers in this area, the support of this workshop will promote an important and timely research topic. Crystal growth is itself profoundly interesting and significant, and modeling such processes, the focus of the workshop and school, is inherently interdisciplinary and demanding. From a fundamental vantage point, studying crystal growth yields important understanding of thermodynamic phase change, associated self-assembly and pattern-formation phenomena, and kinetic and transport limitations to growth. From a technological viewpoint, a successful crystal growth process represents a quintessential advanced manufacturing system, whose successful modeling and subsequent understanding, control, and optimization are inherently challenging and valuable. NSF support will allow researchers in the US an opportunity to advance their careers through international exposure and future collaboration in this area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Empirical evidence is needed from PUIs that have implemented specific plans to improve post-award support. The central research question addressed in this study is whether a combination of targeted initiatives supporting institutional research administration infrastructure can facilitate a rapid and effective transition of a PUI grants office from a “developing” to a “mature” phase. Specific project goals include optimizing efficiency of institutional processes to manage sponsored projects; building institutional knowledge of grants administration through the creation of resources for training and supporting PIs and administrative staff; and developing an undergraduate training program in Research Administration.<br/><br/>The University of St. Thomas (UST), a PUI in Saint Paul, MN, with an expanding portfolio of externally funded research, will create a support structure for funded PIs that will serve as a national model for other emerging research institutions (ERIs) and specifically as a resource for 17 other PUIs in Minnesota. Though the focus will be on the Minnesota cohort, the model will be scalable and applicable to PUIs/ERIs across the country. An additional benefit of the program will be initiation of a research administrator training pipeline focused on departmental research administration to help meet the current urgent need for such personnel across the country. The overarching goal is to build a research administration infrastructure that can sustain the current and anticipated future growth in externally funded research over the next 20 years at UST in a scalable manner, share resources, and serve as a case study for PUIs and other ERIs nationwide, supporting the role of these institutions in a national transformation of the research enterprise. This goal will be accomplished through three iterative project domains: (1) assessing needs, implementing solutions, and assessing effectiveness at UST; (2) sharing resources with partner institutions through the Minnesota Private College Council (MPCC) and assessing the transferability of these solutions to PUIs; and (3) sharing resources nationally through conference presentations and publications. Each objective is coupled with specific evaluation criteria that will be tested by an external evaluator, enabling an assessment of each of these activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Architecture—e.g., the extent and type of branching—of a polymer underpins its thermomechanical properties and, consequently, applications. For instance, linear architecture of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) leads to stiff materials that could be used as milk jugs; meanwhile, highly branched linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) is more flexible and extensible, which supports applications like plastic bags. Accessing a spectrum of architectures for a given polymer remains a challenge. The proposed research will address this challenge by developing catalysts and new mechanisms that can rearrange the bond between atoms in the polymer skeleton, thereby turning branched chains into linear ones, and vice versa. This chemistry will allow scientists and engineers to design new types of plastics with variable and changeable properties, such as force-responsive materials that change properties upon stretching or compressing, or materials with improved degradation/recyclability properties. This project will provide interdisciplinary research training to students and help to prepare a skilled workforce for academia and industry. As a part of this work, polymer-focused educational programs will be developed that integrate concepts of sustainability and circularity. <br/><br/>This proposal will develop branched-to-linear transformations of polymer backbones via catalyzed sigmatropic rearrangements. Transition metal- and organo-catalyzed [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements will be developed to isomerize a broad range of vinyl sidechain-containing polymer classes between branched and linear architectures. The specific ratio of the branched-to-linear conversion will be dictated by the percent conversion and the thermodynamics of a given system. These rearrangements will result in transformations of the thermal properties of polymers, namely lowering their glass transition temperatures and increasing their crystallinity. The stereospecific nature of concerted [3,3]-rearrangements will be utilized to enable tacticity transfer from starting polymers to rearranged polymers. Additionally, mechanical force will be utilized to alter the thermodynamic landscape of the rearrangement reaction coordinates, creating a thermodynamic bias toward linear isomers. Ultimately, this work will leverage a detailed understanding of catalyzed [3,3]-rearrangements of polymer backbones to enable broad architectural and property editing of soft materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response, continual learning is emerging as a promising paradigm to meet this demand. Distinct from other learning paradigms, continual learning emphasizes the ability to maintain performance on previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new information. It focuses on rapid adaptation to new environments by appropriately recalling past knowledge and actively seeking side information to accelerate learning and improve accuracy. However, current methods in continual learning are predominantly empirical and lack a clear theoretical foundation, limiting their wider application and hindering further progress. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a principled framework for continual learning, consisting of novel theoretical insights and practical algorithmic designs. The research outcomes will substantially advance our understanding of continual learning, enrich its algorithmic framework, and provide scalable algorithm packages. The outcomes will be integrated into machine learning courses at all levels, benefiting students across disciplines such as electrical engineering, statistics, and computer science.  The project will actively involve underrepresented students in STEM, synergizing research and education at undergraduate and graduate levels, and developing introductory materials for K-12 students through AI apprenticeship programs.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to pioneer a methodological framework of continual learning for autonomous machine learners navigating dynamic data environments. The framework addresses three essential facets of continual learning. First, it will establish mathematical foundations of continual learning and scalable online algorithms to recollect an evolving memory for fast adaptation and capability expansion. Second, it will develop methods to amplify learning efficiency from informative, even less reliable, pseudo labels. Lastly, it will develop approaches for expanding the predictive power with task-specific assistance from peer learners who possess cross-modal data. The developed foundations will lead to novel algorithms to empower intelligent engineering systems to learn more efficiently and effectively in an ever-changing world. The project will also offer deep insights into pivotal machine learning questions, such as understanding the fundamental trade-offs between adaptivity and forgetting in dynamic learning environments, gauging the maximal influences of minor yet jointly dependent data perturbations on modeling results, and quantifying a model's room for improvement when the underlying law of probability remains elusive. Furthermore, these developments are anticipated to have broader impacts, enabling resource-constrained machine learners to continually broaden their learning capabilities in complex practical applications, such as intelligent transportation systems and cellular performance management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators seek to understand the processes in massive stars during their final years before exploding. The investigators will use two sets of optical telescopes in New Mexico and Crete, Greece known as the Total-Coverage Ultra-Fast Response to Binary-Mergers Observatory (TURBO) to image a small set of nearby galaxies. By taking images every several minutes, they will be able to detect the first brief pulse of light emerging from supernovae in those galaxies. These observations will probe the exploding stars’ internal structure and recent mass loss. A second objective of the program is to study the mergers of pairs of neutron stars. Such mergers emit ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves. Following an alert from a gravitational-wave observatory, TURBO will begin searching for light emitted by the merger. TURBO’s uniquely fast response of two seconds will allow it to find rapidly fading sources. Successful detections will provide insight into whether such mergers are primarily responsible for Earth’s heavy elements. The program will involve students from UMN-Morris, which serves a significant Native American student body, as well as New Mexico Tech, an Hispanic-serving institution. The project will develop the ability to stream TURBO imaging to classrooms and will use Zooniverse to involve the public. <br/><br/>Observations of the initial pulse, or breakout of the internal shock at the surface of the SN progenitor, (4–6 each year) can be expected to connect the properties of progenitors to those of the SNe, as well as provide new insight into the structure of massive stars just before the explosion. Furthermore, the investigators expect to identify the shock breakout of the massive progenitor of a “failed SN” in a nearby galaxy. A global and growing network of gravitational-wave detectors has now observed a total of more than one-hundred mergers of compact objects. TURBO will be used to rapidly image hundreds of square degrees for counter parts of gravitational-wave events. TURBO has a unique ability to leverage LIGO’s new early warning alerts and observe mergers as they happen across large areas on the sky. It will provide targets to global follow-up facilities. With an optical counterpart, mergers will enable a measurement of the Hubble constant, addressing the current tension, in addition to the r-process yields of kilonovae.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But despite the widespread use of resilience language in the environmental literature, its definition is often omitted or disputed. The mathematical field of dynamical systems is recognized as a common language in which to formalize and reconcile sometimes disparate notions of resilience. Using this lens, one finds that a majority of resilience metrics are based on equilibria (steady states) of a system and the like, despite the fact that repeated disturbances such as fires and hurricanes can drive a system far away from these states. This project addresses this gap in the dynamical theory of disturbance and resilience. The two research threads described below advance our understanding of non-equilibrium dynamics and the interactions between ongoing disturbance and recovery. In addition to connecting the PI to research collaborators at other institutions, the project broadens undergraduate research opportunities at Carleton, the liberal arts college where the PI teaches. Seniors engage with the PI's research through capstone projects, while summer research students are recruited earlier in their college careers. To enhance student research experiences and build community among local applied mathematicians, the project also supports a pilot series of vertically integrated summer workshops themed on communication.<br/><br/>Characterizing the outcome of ongoing disturbances in dynamical models of ecosystems leads to novel mathematical questions addressed in two research threads of this project. The first thread generalizes the concept of ""intensity"" from attractors to Morse sets in order to measure vulnerability of a broader class of dynamic structures to disturbance. Prior intensity theory describes resilience of attractors to unknown time-varying perturbations and/or modeling errors. In collaboration with experts in Conley theory, the PI extends intensity first to repellers and then to general Morse sets. The second research thread, flow-kick models, investigates the dynamics induced when periodic, discrete disturbances (""kicks"") punctuate continuous recovery modeled by a flow. To inform scientists' model selection, the PI and collaborators investigate the conditions under which ordinary differential equations (ODEs) capture the rough dynamics of a flow-kick system. Based on existing results for hyperbolic fixed points and saddle-node bifurcations, it is conjectured that periodic orbits and Hopf bifurcations continue from an ODE model to ""nearby"" flow-kick models with the same average disturbance rate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A modern paradigm in number theory uses highly symmetric functions to answer the most fundamental questions about solutions of equations in several variables.

To make connections with special functions in number theory, particularly matrix coefficients of algebraic groups over local fields, one needs new results on quantum group modules. The PI and collaborators will use quantum affine Lie superalgebra modules to produce lattice models with the required symmetry used in the study of matrix coefficients for metaplectic groups.

Superconductivity, the ability of electrons to conduct electric current without dissipation below a certain temperature called Tc,  is not only one of the most remarkable phenomena emerging from the quantum physics of many interacting electrons but is also of great technological importance. Metrology, lossless energy transmission, and quantum computation are important examples.   Earlier theoretical studies of superconductivity  were  based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model, which  assumed that electrons are weakly interacting.  This  approach was questioned after the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity  first in  cuprate oxides and then in other series of compounds, including, most recently,   graphene-based systems.  Experiments revealed that  these  materials display behavior, which  differs fundamentally from that expected for ordinary superconductors both above Tc and  below Tc.   These discoveries called for a qualitatively new theory of superconductivity in the regime of strong interactions between electrons.   In this project, the PI and his students will work to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in these unusual materials and the competition between superconductivity and other ordered states of interacting electrons, such as magnetism.   This is a problem with  no easy answer because  strong interaction makes  it more difficult to establish a dissipation-less current flow, required for superconductivity.   At the same time, the stronger the interaction the higher Tc is expected. Understanding the dual role of strong interactions  also the interplay between superconductivity and other possible ordered states  is the main goal of the proposed work. Theoretical advances resulting from this project may guide the identification of  materials with  higher  superconducting transition  temperatures  and desirable properties, which should have  a revolutionary impact on society.   This project will  contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by training two graduate students.  The PI will continue  running conferences  and lecturing at schools for  graduate students and junior faculty.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education which will examine  superconductivity in the strong coupling regime.   This is a central problem in experimental and theoretical condensed-matter physics. In addition to incipient practical applications, the interest in this field is driven by the fascinating variety of observed effects and universality of underlying  theoretical ideas. The PI will focus on several fundamental issues related to a system behavior near a quantum-critical  point (QCP), where interaction, mediated by a soft critical boson, provides a mechanism for  pairing and at the same time gives rise to non-Fermi liquid normal state behavior.   The issues the PI  will address include understanding: the competition between fermionic incoherence and Cooper pairing, a fundamentally non-BCS  pairing mechanism,  how dynamical vortices emerge, a topological transition that occurs when the number of vortices becomes infinite, the bound  pair state without phase coherence, and the collective modes of a quantum-critical superconductor. The PI will also analyze theoretically superconductivity emerging from a pseudogap state, with special emphasis  on the behavior of superfluid stiffness and on the range where bound pairs of fermions form, but remain incoherent and do not give rise to supercurrent.   In related studies, the PI will analyze superconductivity in a two-dimensional  metal near a van Hove singularity and near the end point of s-wave superconductivity in systems with electron-phonon attraction and  Hubbard repulsion.   The PI will  contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by training two graduate students  in modern theoretical condensed matter physics and will continue  running conferences and workshops and lecturing at schools for  graduate students and junior faculty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nitinol is a metal with remarkable properties including super-elasticity, which is the ability to stretch like rubber and recover the original shape after unloading, and the shape-memory effect, in which a bar bent to a “permanent” shape like a paper clip, recovers its original straight shape after heating. These characteristics are exploited in a variety of important biomedical devices, such as cardiac stents. However, repeated loading of these devices after they are implanted in a patient, for example expansion and contraction due to blood flow driven by a beating heart, can cause them to break at microscopic material defects, such as non-metallic inclusions. This NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence at FDA (NSF FDA SiR) research project seeks to improve the ability of engineers to design nitinol devices that are less likely to fail by developing a specialized multiscale computational method that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to model the behavior of the nitinol atoms in the small volume near a defect. The method will be validated against specially designed fracture experiments to ensure its correctness. This approach will speed development of new medical devices, improve regulatory pathways to market, and reduce the risk to patients. <br/><br/>This research approach is based on the three-dimensional quasicontinuum method (QC3D), which is concurrent multiscale method that dramatically reduces the computational cost relative to fully-atomistic methods through a coarse graining approach. Full atomistic resolution is retained in regions where “interesting” phenomena is occurring, such as phase transformations or bond breaking near a defect, whereas the rest of the device is modeled using a nonlinear finite element approximation employing Cauchy-Born kinematics. QC3D is a systematic approximation to the exact fully-atomistic result, which converges with mesh resolution. However, agreement with reality depends on the accuracy of the interatomic potential (IP) used to model the atomic interactions in the atomistic regions and as the basis of the Cauchy-Born constitutive response. To validate the QC3D approach, predictions using existing physics-based IPs and new AI-based IPs will be compared with fracture toughness experiments on single crystal and/or polycrystal nitinol samples. Experiments will include standard 3-point bending experiments as well as a novel fracture gap test that can be used to explore the effect of compressive stress on phase transformations at the crack tip. The validated QC3D method will be applied to study the effect of non-metallic inclusions on nitinol fracture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project team, which includes researchers, librarians, museum educators, and experience designers, aims to bridge research and practitioner knowledges to produce bidirectional insights for the future of museum design and museum-based learning research. The research involves gathering, scoping, and synthesizing 25 years of research and evaluation on Family Learning Conversations conducted in museum settings, and formally incorporating practitioner-generated knowledge to spark the next generation of design and research on family learning in museums. This project is structured differently than a traditional synthesis in order to achieve the broadest impacts. Museum practitioners drive the synthesis, contributing their own practice-based knowledge, questions, and critical commentary to each part of the synthesis work. For practitioners, literature syntheses that identify how their existing ideas relate to research findings provide ecologically grounded and accessible insights for design. For researchers, understanding how practitioners identify learning or valuable interactions distinct from what has been valued in FLC research historically provides fertile ground for innovation in research methods and research questions. By bringing researchers with expertise in informal learning, video-based discourse analysis, and evidence synthesis into collaboration with museum educators, designers, and evaluators from institutions of varying size and emphases, the project is synthesizing research knowledge and practice knowledge that is fundamentally practitioner-driven, making knowledge in informal learning research more accessible to practitioners, and generating new questions and insights for further practical and research development.<br/><br/>This work contributes directly to advancing knowledge through synthesis of 25 years of museum Family Learning Conversations research in direct response to museum practitioners, while attending to how shifting values in museum education have shaped prior research and require new directions for future work. Using both rigorous literature synthesis processes and ongoing collaborative partnership with a cohort of museum educators, designers, and evaluators, the project is reactivating this literature and research approach, providing practical guidance for research design based in intertwined research and practitioner knowledges and charting a new vision forward for museum family learning research. The work involves first describing the existing knowledge of research and practitioners regarding design for FLC and then generating a focused mixed methods meta-synthesis on a practitioner-prioritized line-of-research. The project team is also engaging in a critical reflection on research methods used in FLC research and identifying underlying values shaping current knowledge and new avenues of investigation to further knowledge generation. Through targeted dissemination to museum practitioner and museum family learning researchers, the project aims to create bi-directional learning and to make the wealth of FLC research more accessible and interpretable through a rigorous synthesis that centers the values and priorities of museum practitioners at every stage of the work.<br/><br/>This Integrating Research and Practice project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.

The project's implications extend far beyond security, poised to influence fields as diverse as social sciences, biological network analysis, and misinformation studies. Importantly, the project is also committed to educational excellence and knowledge dissemination. Integrating the project's findings into the academic curriculum aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application, nurturing a new generation of experts skilled in the nuances of network security. The project also extends significantly into student development, aiming to foster a nurturing environment for student involvement. It provides valuable research opportunities for both undergraduates and graduates. Through hands-on projects, software development, and data analysis tasks, students will gain practical experience and insights into real-world applications of their studies.

Many AI algorithms operate as ""black boxes"" and lack transparency in their decision-making processes, which can be problematic in critical applications. Additionally, inadequate training data can lead to biases, lack of robustness, and overfitting, resulting in inaccurate predictions, especially with new or unseen data.

One such problem is few-shot domain adaptation, which uses knowledge from a related domain to build models for a target domain with limited unlabeled data. This is particularly relevant to automated threat detection, where events of interest are rare and have few examples. Effective metrics for learning from minimal target data will be explored. Another focus is few-shot graph generation, which can advance the theoretical understanding of machine learning on graphs with very limited training data. This is crucial for building trustworthy systems, as many relevant threat detection scenarios involve social and transportation networks.

The problem of predicting the impact of combined stresses is even more complicated in mutualistic relationships, where species depend on each other, and stress on one species can indirectly affect the other. However, it is crucial to understand how combined stresses impact mutualisms, because mutualisms are common and essential for everything from crop production to global nutrient cycling.

The researchers will test this hypothesis through integrating computational and experimental approaches based on a model obligate mutualism between strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica that rely on each other for essential metabolites. The researchers will carry out over 3,900 growth experiments to test the impact of drug combinations on the growth of bacteria in monoculture and mutualistic co-culture. The researchers will also do over 150 evolution experiments to test how species interactions alter the rate and mechanisms by which resistance to multiple stresses evolves in monoculture and mutualism.

The second method is a study of information collected at the time wells were drilled to look how breakouts across an area relate to rock layering. The team will develop new statistical tools to compare datasets from the project, which may prove useful in many other situations. The project will involve the training of one graduate student and multiple undergraduate students as well as curricular materials for high school students.<br/><br/>Borehole breakouts are used to infer stress directions in the shallow crust. By assuming rocks are homogeneous and isotropic, breakout directions are inferred to form parallel to the minimum horizontal stress. However, the rocks in which breakouts are commonly found are often layered mudstones, shales, and sandstones in sedimentary basins, all of which are anisotropic. This proposal uses two research methods to study how anisotropy, due to rock layering, impacts stress inferences from breakouts. The first approach relies on physical experiments to investigate how and when anisotropy—in the form of layer orientation, layer thickness, and material strength—may impact breakout directions. The advantage of an analogue modeling approach is that the problem can be simplified to isolate a variable of interest, namely, the orientation of layering versus the applied stresses. The second approach relies on the analysis of well logs, seeking to amass a rich dataset of breakout azimuths, local bedding directions, and lithologic information from a natural system—in central California—to look for patterns between these datasets. Breakout data from this region provided critical support for the “weak-fault hypothesis” for the San Andreas fault, reflecting the importance of studying this region. Preliminary re-analysis of published data shows it is not straightforward to replicate the prior results. Further, breakouts are often parallel to bedding strike or dip direction, suggesting that local anisotropy may play a larger role than previously recognized. Statistical tools will be developed to analyze data from both projects because the data types are not straightforward to compare. The experimental results will be leveraged to better understand the conditions in which anisotropy might impact breakout directions from the natural dataset from California, which may help identify breakouts that reflect local conditions like layering rather than regional stresses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A principal goal of network neuroscience is to understand how the organization of this network helps support cognition, evolves over the course of the human lifespan, and becomes compromised in disease and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, virtually all progress made towards addressing these questions has relied upon one particular network model for mathematically representing patterns of brain connectivity, at the expense of other models that could provide complementary or unique insight. This project aims to extend and validate an alternative edge-centric framework for representing and analyzing patterns of brain connectivity. The project will deliver new insights into the relationship of brain network organization with cognitive/behavioral phenotypes and shed light on brain network dynamics at ultra-fast timescales are paralleled by changes in subjects' cognitive states. This research will support cross-disciplinary collaboration among the brain sciences, informatics, and statistics, and will support a diverse set of trainees at all levels, from high school to postdoctoral.<br/><br/>This principal innovation of the edge-centric framework is a spatiotemporal decomposition of functional connections into their framewise contributions. This decomposition yields a time series of co-fluctuations for every pair of brain regions (edges in the network). The first aim investigates the novel construct of edge functional connectivity -- the correlation pattern estimated among all pairs of co-fluctuation time series. Edge connectivity will be generated for a large cohort of subjects (N > 1000) using imaging data acquired both at rest and while subjects were performing cognitively demanding tasks. Multivariate statistical methods will be used to discover robust associations between edge connectivity and subjects' behavioral, demographic, and clinical measures. The second aim analyzes co-fluctuation time series directly, taking advantage of the ultra-fast timescale at which they are estimated to investigate potential drivers of brain network reconfiguration during naturalistic viewing (movie-watching). This project advances the edge-centric framework as a viable tool for general neuroscientific discovery and will open the door for future studies to investigate brain-behavior relationships and network dynamics in applied contexts and not restricted to large-scale imaging data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To store and access unstructured data, Log-Structured-Merge tree-based Key-Value Stores (LSM-KVS) have become essential data storage systems, widely deployed by most of the large IT service companies. As application workloads vary and continuously scale up, existing LSM-KVS systems, designed based on monolithic servers and shared-nothing architectures, face numerous issues, including resource inefficiency, difficulty in load balancing, low scalability, and poor elasticity. This project aims to develop and optimize LSM-KVS-based systems within disaggregated infrastructure environments, consisting of multiple compute servers and heterogeneous memory and storage farms connected via fast networks. The project will address several fundamental issues, including heavy network traffic between resource pools caused by compaction and shard-migration, memory limitations of read and write buffers, tightly coupled control of otherwise decoupled resource-intensive modules by LSM-KVS, and more frequent and complex transient errors. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to redesign and optimize an LSM-KVS architecture for disaggregated infrastructure, called Decoupled-LSM, to achieve higher performance, better resource utilization, and improved management. The Decoupled-LSM project will devise new techniques that decouple data-intensive modules from the control of LSM-KVS, execute the modules in different resource pools efficiently, and attain high performance, better resource utilization, and greater flexibility in disaggregated environments. Decoupled-LSM will lay the foundation for a new LSM-KVS architecture optimized over disaggregated infrastructure for many critical applications, such as cloud computing, AI, ML, and scientific computing, which impact daily life. Overall, this project can help to better store, use, and manage extremely large-scale unstructured data, used by government, industry, and individuals. The proposed methodologies, system designs, and implemented components will benefit the storage and networking research communities in further developing storage systems for disaggregated infrastructure and cloud computing.

This investigation will discover the molecules that regulate how specific neurons that control reproductive behaviors are generated by using the worm C. elegans as a model. As genes that control fundamental processes are often similar among diverse organisms, these studies may provide a basis for future investigations that shed light on human reproduction and on nervous system differences and disorders that display a sex bias. The study is fully integrated in the curricular courses of undergraduate students at Carleton College who will investigate how neurons develop and make connections that allow them to regulate reproduction. Undergraduate course-based and summer research experiences will engage students in answering significant questions in developmental neurobiology, practicing independent thinking, critical analysis, engagement with literature, and effective communication.<br/><br/>This work seeks to elucidate how sex-determining signals are integrated with sex-shared programs of neural development, using the well-understood neuronal development of the nematode C. elegans as a model. In C. elegans, several neuroblasts of the P lineage divide in males, but not in hermaphrodites, initiating divergent programs of differentiation in the ventral cord and tail. These sex-specific programs depend on the sex determination factor TRA-1 and the Hox proteins MAB-5 and LIN-39. This work investigates the role of TRA-1 and the Hox proteins, as well as seeking previously unknown regulatory components, such as cell cycle regulators and developmental timers. The investigators and their undergraduate students have developed reagents to address how these regulators interact with each other to promote sex-specific nervous system organization. A cell cycle sensor and a masculinized P lineage strain, P-masc, allow exploration of the mechanisms by which sex-determining factors act within neuronal lineages to influence early neurogenesis as well as differentiation, circuit formation, and behavior. Whereas previous studies of masculinized neurons have focused on later stages of neuronal development and function, this work will identify early events in the organization of the sex-specific nervous system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project concerns a recently formalized measure of complexity --resolvent degree -- introduced to quantify the difficulty of solving polynomials. Drawing on both classical and modern techniques in number theory and algebraic geometry, this project will enrich our understanding of resolvent degree as a measure of complexity in other contexts. The broader impacts of this project will support ongoing community building amongst underrepresented student affinity groups, including developing researchers from their ranks and contributing to professional development through conference attendances.

Yet, despite continued efforts by researchers and practitioners in the field, there remain substantial gaps in knowledge on how to effectively prevent, disrupt, and dismantle human trafficking and remediate the harms human trafficking causes. What the field needs is large-scale and nuanced research on the interconnections between individuals, trafficking operations, the wide range of commercial sex market segments, community contexts, and root causes. This planning grant brings together a diverse group, including researchers from multiple disciplines, human trafficking survivor-leaders, and other stakeholders (e.g., service providers and law enforcement), to develop a national-level action research center and build a transdisciplinary team capable of carrying out this long-term research agenda. Participants will co-create a plan for building, organizing, and sustaining a new research center called “Human-Centered Action Research to Disrupt Trafficking (HART).”<br/><br/>The planning approach for the HART Center uses a novel scientific approach to design a research agenda by converging social sciences, health sciences, and computational modeling with lived expertise from survivors of trafficking and other key stakeholders. The transdisciplinary team has a national scope with expertise to capture the realities and nuances of a broad range of trafficking contexts ethically and accurately and to translate that research to practice. This deep collaboration provides a realistic ground-truth for the direction and scale of research questions. It also enables identification and avoidance of unintended negative consequences that too often arise from human trafficking research and prevention and intervention efforts. Harms to avoid include, among other things, re-traumatizing survivors through invasive research surveys and interviews, over-focusing on some contexts leading to skewed results, inadvertently arresting victims in law enforcement interventions, and wasting resources on well-meaning, but ultimately ineffective strategies. The planning approach equalizes the playing field among participants with a carefully managed process that attends to power differentials, builds trust, and fosters shared understanding among people with diverse experience and perspectives. Methods for planning use cutting-edge strategies for team building, appreciative inquiry, and participatory collaboration through a series of interactive remote meetings culminating in an in-person convening. The results of the planning process are threefold: 1) develop shared values and research philosophy for the HART center; 2) identify key human trafficking research thrusts; and 3) build a team and project plan to address these thrusts that focus on the complex social, legal, economic, and human rights challenges of human trafficking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly emphasized in neurology where experts spend a substantial amount of time visually reviewing lengthy multi-channel time series of brain activity, called electroencephalography (EEG). Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a potential solution to ease this burden and create reliable and scalable solutions. However, most EEG ML models, which are based on supervised learning, do not yield meaningful EEG features because of labeling inconsistencies. In addition, these models have not been rigorously tested in out-of-sample settings and therefore can exhibit performance deficits during deployment leading to incorrect diagnoses or decisions. As such, there is a compelling need to develop more reliable, reproducible, and robust ML approaches for EEG review. The goal of this proposal is to develop a trustworthy ML framework to augment clinical EEG review and demonstrate its utility in real-world clinical applications. Our research will significantly improve the diagnostic capabilities of EEG while reducing physician workload. We will demonstrate the framework’s ability to augment EEG review by working closely with domain experts at the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. We will also enable research opportunities for undergraduate and K-12 students, especially underrepresented minorities, and engage students with epilepsy in focused research projects. Finally, we will leverage the outcomes of this research to develop courses in engineering and medicine.<br/><br/>This research will develop a suite of novel ML methods to realize a trustworthy ML framework to augment EEG review. We will undertake the following strategies to ensure trust in EEG ML: a) developing domain-guided backbone architectures for EEG representation learning, b) leveraging self and weak supervision, instead of label-hungry and error-prone supervised learning, to scale up available training data, and c) performing model diagnostics to identify and rectify failure scenarios.

The United States faces an acute shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs), a trend projected to worsen over the next decade, potentially jeopardizing the effectiveness of the healthcare system.  The shortage is exacerbated by many family medicine residents opting for sub-specialization or hospitalist roles instead of becoming family medicine physicians.  A major contributing factor to this trend is the prevailing emphasis within family medicine residency training programs on hospital-based experiences rather than outpatient primary care.

The most common sources of such records target the geochemical composition of the mineral that corals produce. For example, measurements of Sr/Ca in coral skeletons allow us to reconstruct past temperature because Sr substitutes for Ca in the coral skeleton’s mineral aragonite lattice in a temperature-dependent manner. However, the mineral aragonite is not the only phase that exists in coral skeletons. For decades, it has been known that coral aragonite contains ~1% by weight of water. While this water has been investigated for its potential to trap samples of ancient seawater, the water has never been visualized in situ in the coral skeleton. The gap in our understanding of how and where coral skeletons archive water limits the ability to leverage the presence of water in corals as a paleoclimate archive. This research will create 2D and 3D maps of water in lab-grown coral skeletons using nanoscale imaging techniques. Proposed experiments will also fingerprint the origin of water in coral skeletons and test the ability of coral skeletons to retain water after the skeleton is formed. Ultimately, this work could open the door to using water in coral skeletons as an archive of past seawater conditions, helping to develop better models/forecasts and conservation efforts for coral reefs. The work will also support an early career scientist, transitioning to mid-career, at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. The project will provide opportunities for at least ten St. Olaf College undergraduate students from a range of STEM disciplines to engage in sustained research with mentorship designed to support underrepresented groups in STEM. Additionally, the PI will co-create a science communication conference for academic and non-academic participants with St. Olaf’s public-facing Institute for Freedom and Community. <br/><br/>Water in coral skeletons has been investigated for its paleoproxy potential, implicated as a facilitator of diagenetic transformations, and linked to the presence of ‘vital effects’ (i.e. geochemical patterns in coral aragonite that differ from those expected for inorganic aragonite). At present, however, the scientific community lacks knowledge about where this water exists and its origin. Specifically, water has never yet been visualized in coral skeletons and its exact origin and form is not confidently known. This project seeks to improve the understanding of water’s distribution and origin in coral skeletons by creating 2D and 3D maps of the distribution of water in cultured cold-water corals (Balanophyllia elegans) grown in deuterated water using Nanoscale Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT), respectively. Given concerns about contamination with ambient water, the analysis of corals cultured in deuterated water will ensure that these analyses identify water incorporated into the coral skeleton during growth, and not water introduced by contamination during sample preparation. Additionally, this work will test the ability of corals to retain intra-skeletal water incorporated at the time of calcification using deuterium isotope immersion experiments with natural corals that will subsequently be analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These analyses will help determine whether the isotopic composition of water in the sample (whether it is free or bound to organics) has been overprinted during the immersion process. Finally, the proposed work will test if coral water records coral metabolism, seawater properties, or a combination of both. Specifically, this work will produce cultured corals grown in solutions bubbled with Ar gas having different isotopic compositions in order to ground-truth whether coral skeletons record dissolved noble gasses in seawater. It will also produce cultured samples fed with deuterium-labeled food in order to explore the impact of coral metabolism on the isotopic composition of water measured in the coral skeletons. If the proposed work shows that water in corals can be used as an archive of seawater isotopic composition, coral metabolism, and/or noble gasses, it could lead to big-picture impacts such as improving our understanding of hydrological variability through new records of seawater δ18O or the response of coral metabolism to thermal stress and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geoscience is a critical discipline for today’s world, integrating other physical and life sciences into a wholistic perspective with relevance to the most pressing challenges facing humanity today including climate change, energy resources, and natural hazards. However, the number of graduates and students pursuing geosciences is not sufficient to meet the demand for geoscience expertise in the economy.  While geoscience degrees can provide students with significant opportunities to learn and practice workforce-relevant skills, many systemic barriers prevent equal participation, exacerbating the gap in the geoscience workforce. Through intentional professional development, the Cultural Change in Geoscience (C-ChanGe) project will create a corps of faculty change agents empowered to make successive, incremental changes that will lead to positive cultural shifts within their home departments. This cultural change will foster an environment where all people experience academic geoscience as safe, welcoming, and supportive. C-ChanGe will also compile and leverage existing efforts focused on cultural change. This will create a network of leaders and resources that raises the visibility of all aspects of this important work and enhances opportunities for collaboration.<br/><br/>C-ChanGe will generate positive systemic change in the culture of academic geoscience departments and community through facilitating professional development for geoscience faculty that will a) foster high-quality discussion and sharing of evidence-based practices, b) develop web resources with geoscience-specific examples, c) promote change in participant attitudes and d) equip participants with resources to lead further change in their department and community. This project will provide faculty with concrete ways to implement inclusive strategies in their individual practice at many scales, professional development to overcome barriers to inclusion and belonging for students from marginalized identities, and training to help participants share what they learn with colleagues in their local program, department, and institution. The project will also leverage existing expertise to generate a national network of projects focused on making academic geoscience more inclusive, welcoming, and supportive of people from diverse backgrounds and identities. This network will elevate the national visibility of existing efforts within the geosciences and provide opportunities for collaboration among disparate programs. Through this network, we will create a cycle by which C-ChanGe participants learn from the cutting-edge research and implementation of impactful practices, are able to apply this learning in their local context, and then provide information to the project network about the efficacy and challenges of implementing those research-informed practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extensive agriculture above ground and fast water flow through caves and other openings below ground make the region at risk for groundwater contamination, which has been an ongoing problem for decades but has recently reached a state of emergency in many communities relying on groundwater for their drinking water supply. This project aims to identify key controls of groundwater quality at springs. Springs act like windows into what is happening below ground, and are also important ecologically, culturally, and economically, making them excellent study sites. A team of college students will visit 200 or more springs across the region, recording the same set of basic information about geology, water quality, and flow rates. This data set will then be used to test hypotheses about which factors contribute to healthier springs, and will be made public. The results of this study can help guide groundwater resource stewardship in the future. Additionally, the students involved in the project will receive mentoring, technical methods training, and real-world field experiences that will help prepare them for careers in the earth sciences.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to test hypotheses as to the relative importance of stratigraphic position, groundwater age and provenance, springshed land use, and geographic location on spring water quality. Previous studies have either focused on recording flow rates and contaminant concentrations over time at a single point in space, or surveyed many points in space at different points in time. The temporal range makes interpretation difficult, and the spatial scope is often limited by state boundaries. This project will record patterns in space over a short window of time, enabling more meaningful analyses - students will conduct a synoptic “snapshot in time” survey of 200 springs across the region, under baseflow-dominated conditions at two points during the same hydrologic year (midwinter and late summer). For a subset of springs, tritium, stable isotope, and major ion analysis will be used to determine groundwater age and provenance. The survey will include existing and planned long-term spring monitoring sites (known as “sentinel springs”). The synoptic survey will allow sentinel springs to be understood in their broader regional context, while the sentinel springs provide a more in-depth understanding of individual sites in the survey, significantly increasing the information value of each dataset.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These technologies enable researchers to study, for example, the spatial variation of gene expression across cells or tissues, offering a high-resolution perspective of complex biological dynamics. This perspective allows researchers to better understand disease mechanisms and can lead to the development of novel treatments. However, the data generated by these technologies are high-dimensional and dependent, which can complicate statistical inference. Existing inferential methods are often subjective or unreliable, either requiring user input that may bias or invalidate results, or requiring rigid model assumptions that are frequently violated in practice.  This project will address these issues by developing statistical methods that do not rely on user input, and work reliably in more general settings than existing methods. The new methods will be theoretically justified and equipped with fast computational algorithms.  Software implementing these methods will be made publicly available, enabling their wide use in academia and industry. The project will also provide training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project develops new statistical methods for inference with high-dimensional dependent data, motivated by challenges in analyzing single-cell and spatially-resolved sequencing data. Specific challenges include the failure of traditional inferential methods when the parameter is at or near the boundary of the parameter space; the need to both generate and test hypotheses from the same data without inflating Type I error rates; and insufficient model flexibility and scalability.  The investigator will address each of these issues directly by (i) developing a new test procedure that resolves a well-known challenge of constructing confidence regions for variance components (or functions thereof) near zero; (ii) providing a unified approach for valid post-clustering inference with high-dimensional data from a broad class of distributions; and (iii) developing a general class of penalized mixture models that accommodates multiple latent sources of heterogeneity. The methodological developments in this project lay the groundwork for more general methods addressing more broad challenges in inference near the boundary of the parameter space, post-selection inference, and modeling heterogeneous high-dimensional data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although academics have developed complex new controls built on models that are supposed to be more accurate, the traffic controls used in practice rely on theories and models that are at least two decades out of date, with no plans to implement the new methods that already exist from research. This issue leads to a fundamental research question: can controls based on more advanced theories perform better than legacy theories in practice? A positive answer will provide a tighter connection between research and practitioners to justify use of new research, and a negative answer will identify causes for performance differences that will inform future research and prepare for next-generation design of transportation and traffic control systems. The societal benefits could include reduced traffic congestion and lower travel times, which improves the well-being of travelers. This project also advances the field by improving the likelihood that traffic control research in general will become useful to practice. Results will be disseminated through conferences, curriculum redesign and development, as well as collaborations with industry and community partners through various educational and outreach activities. <br/><br/>The technical approach to the research is based on studying differences between widely accepted traffic flow models and real traffic from public vehicle trajectory data in the new transportation era. Kinematic wave theory is the most common macroscopic flow model, but how useful is the continuous partial differential equation for describing discrete vehicle traffic? How does heterogeneity in vehicle types and driver behaviors affect model accuracy, which is well-known as the variance in the congested side of the flow-density relationship? How does stochasticity in travel demand and route choices affect controls built for the average value? By modifying traffic flow models to include specific characteristics (such as time- and space-varying flow-density relationships caused by heterogeneous vehicles), researchers will test the importance of such characteristics on predicting reality. What are the important traffic characteristics to consider for different types of traffic controls? Answering this question might validate that specific existing traffic controls are likely effective in practice, or lead to new traffic flow models that incorporate important traffic behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Synthetic biology seeks to determine the uniqueness and fungibility of these constraints, and one promise of synthetic cell engineering is to transcend the evolutionary constraints that have been handed down to us and instead create life-like systems with expanded chemistries.  The Ellington and Adamala labs seek to leverage the flexibility, evolvability, adaptability, and safety of purely in vitro (test tube-based) systems, to engineer synthetic cells with expanded genetic alphabets and genetic codes.  In particular, they aim to employ non-canonical nucleotides to broaden the scope of codons (triplet and ultimately new quadruplet codons) in the genetic code, ultimately leading to the incorporation of over 24 amino acids (that have distinctive and biotechnologically useful chemistries) into proteins.  Additionally, the project will focus on the biosafety and biosecurity impacts of expanded genetic alphabets.<br/><br/>The development of non-canonical genetic alphabets and codes is rapidly advancing, with various groups exploring novel genetic alphabets that are becoming more accessible both in vitro and in vivo. Successful generation of an 8-letter code, and enzymatic incorporation in vitro, demonstrated utility of this technology for engineering novel genetic systems. However, adapting non-canonical genetic alphabets to non-canonical genetic codes presents challenges, mainly due to interdependencies within biological systems. Attempts to modify genetic alphabets and codes have faced systemic disruptions and fitness impacts in natural cells. In response, the focus is shifting towards synthetic cells, which offer greater control over systems biology, free from the evolutionary constraints of natural cells. This proposal aims to utilize synthetic cells for engineering efforts, particularly exploring the implementation of quadruplet codons for genetic code expansion, a task challenging to address in living cells. The synthetic cell approach allows for rationally designed, bottom-up experimentation and the concomitant resolution of complexities related to codon instantiation, contributing insights to both living and synthetic systems. In this work, the researchers will investigate the incorporation of non-canonical nucleotides into translation (Aim 1), followed by the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids via non-canonical genetic alphabets (Aim 2). Finally, they will use artificial evolution to optimize translation systems with non-canonical nucleotides and amino acids (Aim 3).

Bioremediation – using life, especially bacteria to remove metals and other toxins from AMD streams is more cost effective than other active treatment methods.  In AMD bioremediation, bacteria take iron dissolved in water and turn it into rust. The rust then scrubs other heavy metals from the system. The success of bioremediation relies on how quickly and effectively these organisms can remove iron as rust. However, we don’t know what species remove iron the fastest or how or if iron is redissolved once it is buried. The overarching goal of this research is to unravel what controls the rate at which iron is removed, whether processes in the subsurface can undercut these processes by re-dissolving iron, and whether we can generate an environmental “probiotic” to increase iron removal in AMD sites. <br/><br/>We do not know the species or the geochemical conditions that promote rapid Fe(II) oxidation. Therefore, the researchers will systematically link geochemistry and microbial metabolic potential to iron oxidation rate.  Iron reduction in subsurface environments can undermine bioremediation efforts but little is known about biogeochemistry in the AMD subsurface. Therefore, the researchers will use porewater geochemistry and microbial communities to examine the biogeochemical processes occurring in the AMD subsurface. Seeding microbial communities is a promising strategy for enhancing bioremediation efficacy. However, these efforts can by stymied by complex interactions between geochemistry, ecology, and dispersal. Therefore, the researchers will perform a field scale AMD seeding experiment using constructed AMD ecosystems to determine if seeding is feasible.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Erika Ellison is ""Dissecting the Mechanism of ATHILA Centrophilic Retrotransposition."" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Cambridge (U.K.) and the sponsoring scientist is Professor Ian Henderson.  <br/><br/>Centromeres are critical for eukaryotic chromosome segregation during cell division but have been challenging to study because the DNA sequences are often highly repetitive. Recently, with the advent of long-read DNA sequencing, centromeres have been completely assembled for the first time. In many plant species, this has revealed that centromeres are invaded by retrotransposons. However, how retrotransposons contribute to centromere function and evolution remains unknown. To investigate this, this study will investigate the mechanism of ATHILA retrotransposon integration into the centromere and determine if centromere function and subsequent chromosome segregation is affected in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Results from this project will be broadly relevant and significant across eukaryotes, as retrotransposons within centromeres are conserved in plants and animals. Training objectives include acquiring skills in plant genetics and genomics techniques. Broader impacts include developing a hands-on functional genomics training workshop for undergraduate students enrolled at the Gatsby Plant Science Summer School (https://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/gatsby-plant-science-education-programme/GPSSS).    <br/><br/>Analysis of centromeres from 66 diverse A. thaliana accessions revealed evidence for ongoing ATHILA retrotransposition, including recent outbreaks of ATHILA5 in the French ANGE-B-10 accession. However, the mechanism of ATHILA5 integration and impact on centromere function remains unknown. To explore this, de novo ATHILA5 outbreaks will be triggered by introducing a recently active ATHILA5 from the ANGE-B10 centromere into wild type Arabidopsis and silencing defective mutants, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. This approach provides a direct means to study the dynamics of in planta retrotransposon integration, proliferation, and host-silencing establishment. Additionally, ATHILA5 deletion variants will be generated to determine which ATHILA5 encoded proteins control target-site preference. Although the ATHILA5 ORF1 encoded GAG-POL genes are known to facilitate the LTR-retrotransposon lifecycle, ATHILA5 contains an additional ORF2 that encodes a protein with an unknown function. To test if the ORF2 encoded protein enables ATHILA5 mobilization by suppressing silencing or facilitating cell–cell movement, ORF2 will be overexpressed in Arabidopsis. The ATHILA5 outbreak is consistent with the transposon adaption to proliferate in cell-types that lead to an increase in copy number between generations. For this reason, single-cell RNA-seq will be performed on lines with active ATHILA5 retrotransposition to investigate how ATHILA cell-type specific expression affects germline development and is regulated by host epigenetic silencing. This project will explore the dynamics of transposon regulation in plant genomes and this work is significant for understanding the genetic and epigenetic control that preserves centromere identity during cell division across eukaryotes. All biological materials and datasets generated in this project will be available to the public through publication and public data repositories that include Github, Addgene, and the NCBI’s SRA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum materials with unconventional properties have recently captured the attention of the scientific community. These materials play a crucial role in the development of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), specialized devices that exploit their unique properties. MTJs are building blocks for memory and computing on a nanometer scale that can switch between different magnetic states. One of the exciting aspects of this project is the development of a new kind of computing technology, known as Stochastic Computing Computational Random-Access Memory (SC-CRAM) using these MTJs. This new computing technology promises to be much more efficient than what is currently available. The team will combine theoretical research, material synthesis (making the materials), and advanced manufacturing techniques to bring this vision to life. Overall, the project aims to push the boundaries of current computing technology, making future computing faster, more efficient, and capable of handling more complex tasks with less energy consumption. The outcome of our proposal will directly impact industries engaged in the development of technology for unconventional computing. It will also benefit society by expanding present computation beyond the limits of classical computers. The joint team will reach out to a broad range of groups and cultivate a welcoming and vibrant work environment that promotes mutual respect, effectiveness, and professionalism.

New water input treatments with different irrigation and rainfall simulation scenarios are added to better understand the interaction between climate change and the fate of compost-derived organic matter and associated nutrients that builds up in the soils of urban farms and gardens. From the resulting measurements, budgets are constructed for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water, in order to quantify nutrient recycling and loss, carbon sequestration, and cooling due to evapotranspiration. Objective 2 extends this research to understand the fate of compost-derived nutrients in urban farms and community gardens across Minneapolis-Saint Paul, which have a variety of background soil conditions and management practices. The project includes detailed interviews on soil management practices to construct nutrient budgets for ten farms and measurements of nutrient concentrations in leachate and along vertical profiles to determine the fate of excess nutrients. Objective 3 focuses on comparing various ecosystem services from different urban agriculture land use scenarios using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) suite of models. Calculations of food production and nutrient recycling potential for all scenarios are calculated directly based on project data. The InVEST models for carbon sequestration, urban cooling, urban flood risk mitigation, urban stormwater retention, nutrient delivery, and pollinator habitat are produced for these scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the other hand, Einstein’s theory of gravity dominates the behavior of matter at the largest known scales in our universe. While it is well-tested at large scales, gravity is the only known force for which we do not know the quantum description. There are regimes where one is needed: for instance, deep inside a black hole or shortly after the Big Bang, when our entire gravitating universe was compressed within a tiny region. A theory of quantum gravity aims to fill in these gaps in our fundamental understanding of the universe, but is most tractable in models that do not describe our actual universe. In this project, Professor Zukowski will study quantum gravity in a setting that approximates our known universe. The research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science through an understanding of physical laws. The work will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Zukowski will train both undergraduate and master’s students in this field of research, providing crucial support for their education and career development. She will also give lectures aimed at high school students and the general public about recent developments in quantum gravity.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Zukowski will study quantum gravity in de Sitter spacetime. Using standard techniques in holography as a starting point, she will apply quantum information theoretic tools such as modular Berry transport and complexity to probe bulk geometry. While traditional dS/CFT has presented challenges for generalizing holography beyond asymptotically AdS spacetimes, new avenues are opened by recent developments in Chern-Simons gravity. Professor Zukowski will use these methods to compute new quantum observables for de Sitter. Finally, the project will also connect to cosmology through a further study of the landscape. Performing general warped compactifications and applying a new bootstrap technique for compactifications will constrain the low-energy landscape for quantum gravity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do this, geoscientists collect images of Earth with satellites, run simulations, and test hypotheses with laboratory experiments. All of these methods improve our understanding of landscape change, but scientists using each of these tools struggle to bring their research together to make new insights. This project establishes a framework of interoperable hardware and software tools, called sandpiper, that enables research products from different teams and approaches to integrate with one another more easily than ever before. Major efforts of the project team include (1) designing and implementing an affordable open-source hardware-firmware system for data acquisition, (2) forging a community-backed data standard, (3) developing a flexible and interoperable data-analysis software library, and (4) establishing a sustainable community of practice. The project team is also advancing science and technology education by creating science museum exhibits that demonstrate fundamental principles in geomorphology and reach a wide audience through an interactive web interface.<br/><br/>Recent strides in geomorphology have been fueled by widely available satellite imagery, powerful numerical modeling toolkits, and decades of physical laboratory experiments. Customized algorithms lie at the heart of the discipline because raster data—e.g., photographs, topography—form a fundamental bridge between these complementary modes of inquiry. Transformative insights can arise when researchers apply tools from one mode of inquiry to data from another. However, most innovation at the forefront of geomorphology currently proceeds in silos via ad-hoc algorithms that accumulate “mutations” as they traverse laboratories and graduate-student generations. The problem is particularly acute for experimental geomorphology, where technological barriers have prevented FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and OS (open-source) principles from integration into the research process. At present, there is no unifying framework to support collaboration between modelers, observationalists, and experimentalists. The team for this project is creating such a cyberinfrastructure framework and solving these problems at every level. (1) To break down experimental silos, the project team is designing and implementing a modular and extensible open-source hardware–firmware system to affordably and uniformly make measurements and generate reproducible data products in labs across the world. (2) To promote and simplify data sharing, the project team is organizing a community effort to forge a data standard. (3) To mitigate algorithm drift, the project team is developing a flexible analysis library that integrates with this data standard. (4) To establish a community of practice, the project leaders are engaging researchers in their own laboratories and computing environments to facilitate reusing and contributing algorithms to the library. This acquisition-to-analysis toolchain, called sandpiper, will enable the next generation of collaborative research in geomorphology, sedimentology, and stratigraphy; advances could also influence seemingly unrelated fields like dendrochronology, hydrology, and seismology.<br/><br/>This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the National Discovery Cloud for Climate initiative within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and by the Geosciences Directorate’s Research, Innovation, Synergies, and Education and Earth Sciences divisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rapid incision and lateral migration shifted the bank ~100 m westward in three days. This event, which the investigators have termed an “avulsive dam failure”, provides a brief time window to study the fundamental coupled fluvial and hillslope processes that result from rapid base-level fall, including knickpoint development and retreat coupled with lateral erosion alongside mass-wasting processes associated with sudden valley incision. Climate and land-use change combine to generate larger floods whose erosion then destabilizes the surrounding landscape, thereby producing cascading hazards. The investigators hypothesize that rapid incision and channel migration should immediately follow avulsive dam failure, similarly to basin integration following spillover when a new hydrogeomorphic system is established after breaching a sill. This is followed by relaxation of the river’s longitudinal profile as knickpoints evolve and the river adjusts to a new local base level. The investigators will capture and analyze these geomorphic phenomena through time with repeated collection of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery, supplemented by community-collected data. They will quantify volumes of erosion and deposition, flow velocities, and channel-migration rates using data products derived from structure-from-motion photogrammetry and aerial footage. Aging dam infrastructure across the United States, combined with increased magnitude and frequency of precipitation, will likely drive continued dam failures into the future. The data resulting from this work could inform future management strategies, especially as our national dam infrastructure continues to age. This project will provide high-impact research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students, while serving to mentor them under a collaborative, multi-institutional environment with broad expertise in geospatial and geoscientific disciplines.<br/><br/>Rapid data collection following this avulsive dam failure will help to answer core geomorphic questions about basin integration and subsequent knickzone evolution. Physical models demonstrate that much of the incision from spillover processes occurs during and shortly after the event. Attempts to quantify these changes in a real-world setting must effectively capture these early stages that record the most rapid change within the fluvial system. Additionally, longer-term data will capture knickpoint-retreat rates, including whether the knickpoint remains coherent or diffuses, across stratigraphic units with varied mechanical properties (that is, glacial lake sediments to sandstone bedrock). Over the shorter term, the results of this project may help to explain and predict rapid bluff retreat along the Blue Earth and other rivers, attributed to anthropogenic climate and land-use change. Furthermore, the investigators will quantify downstream sediment dynamics in response to erosion and mobilization of reservoir deposits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FPLC is a technique used to purify and analyze proteins with high reproducibility, yield, and speed. Product proteins can be used in high-quality downstream biochemistry and biophysics experiments. This acquisition will modernize the biochemistry and molecular biology infrastructure in our department, and it will provide training opportunities to prepare students for work in research and industry.<br/><br/>This award aims to enhance several projects in research and teaching. FPLC instruments can be used to run pre-packed affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion columns for protein purification and analysis, with automated control of buffer gradient and flow rate and constant monitoring of pressure, conductivity, and UV-Vis absorbance. FPLC will be used to purify protein kinases such as human vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) from a bacterial expression system. The structure and stability of these variants will be compared using techniques like circular dichroism and differential scanning fluorimetry, which may shed light on their role in disease. The FPLC instrument will also be also used for protein purification and analytical gel filtration of Drosophila melanogaster neuroblast complexes and proteins. This will help to elucidate the roles of proteins like Inscuteable, Pins, and Bazooka in controlling asymmetric cell division. Variants of the enzyme polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase (PETase) will also be purified for development of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), engaging upper-level and introductory chemistry students in thinking about the world’s plastic problem.

It will identify variability in legal constraints on beaver management across political and ecosystem boundaries. It will facilitate knowledge transfer between management practitioners and research communities at local, regional, and continental scales. It will then assemble a summary of the ""state of the science"" that identifies key knowledge gaps and opportunities for progress in both basic and applied beaver science.

Neanderthals, who evolved in Europe and were established there for over 200,000 years, vanished from the fossil record shortly after modern humans entered the area approximately 50,000 years ago. Current explanations for Neanderthals' disappearance center on their inability to compete with modern humans, who had symbolic culture and more advanced technologies. Yet, genetic evidence shows that the two populations made contact and interbred. What was the nature of this contact? Archaeological evidence to answer this question is present at one archaeological site. Fossilized bones of Neanderthals and modern humans have been found in the same stratigraphic layer, meaning that the two populations were contemporaneous. However, some evidence suggests that the modern human fossils may be younger and accidentally became incorporated into an older layer. The focus of this project is to apply numerous scientific techniques to test whether the fossils were deposited at the same time or not. If contemporaneity is confirmed, this site will be the first to provide direct archaeological evidence of the period of interaction when modern humans and Neanderthals met. In addition to answering the scientific questions, the project will train students in cutting-edge methods of archaeological excavation and analysis and provide field as well as lab-based research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Career-building opportunities abound. Undergraduate students needing fieldwork to get jobs or get into graduate school gain valuable skills through their participation in the project. Graduate students' theses benefit from their access to first-class research materials, and networking opportunities with scientists from the U.S. and other countries will expand their job prospects.<br/><br/>This project helps to clarify a crucial period within human evolution. The site is likely one of the earliest sites where such contact occurred. In order to test the contemporaneity of the Neanderthal and modern human fossils, specialists examine the preservation of the bones, radiocarbon date them, and attempt to extract DNA from them.

Attempts to quantify these changes in a real-world setting must effectively capture these early stages that record the most rapid change within the fluvial system. Additionally, longer-term data will capture knickpoint-retreat rates, including whether the knickpoint remains coherent or diffuses, across stratigraphic units with varied mechanical properties (that is, glacial lake sediments to sandstone bedrock). Over the shorter term, the results of this project may help to explain and predict rapid bluff retreat along the Blue Earth and other rivers, attributed to anthropogenic climate and land-use change. Furthermore, the investigators will quantify downstream sediment dynamics in response to erosion and mobilization of reservoir deposits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rotational spectroscopy, when applied to small molecular clusters, provides molecular-level detail about molecular structure and dynamics. However, high resolution spectroscopic studies of proton transfer in small molecular clusters remain largely hindered by the requirement of microsolvent molecules to stabilize the resulting charge separation. Professor Leopold and his students will use superacids to effectively increase the available range of acidities and thus drive proton transfer in clusters that are small enough to study by high resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. Their studies could provide a better understanding of the interactions that enable chemical reactions in small clusters and could deepen our understanding of solvation, which critically influences thermodynamics and reactivity in solution. This work will have broader impact through the training of students, its potential implications for atmospheric chemistry, climate research, and its exemplification of the value of fundamental research through public outreach.<br/><br/>By varying cluster size, as well as the acidity and basicity of the interacting moieties, this work will explore the factors that allow (or disallow) proton transfer in small, jet-cooled acid-base adducts. By using superacids to minimize the microsolvation requirements for proton transfer, the full spectrum of interactions between hydrogen bonding and ion pair formation can be realized within a cluster size range amenable to rotational spectroscopy. Experiments will employ both the older, cavity-style microwave technique of Flygare as well as the newer chirped-pulse method of Pate. The determination of rotational constants, nuclear quadrupole coupling constants, tunneling energies, and internal rotation barriers will provide detailed information about the interactions within the clusters studied. High level computational methods will play a strong supporting role, as they aid in identification of carrier of an observed spectrum and, moreover, provide information such as binding energies and potential surface topology, which cannot be directly determined in these experiments. Thus, theory and experiment are used synergistically to elicit a deeper understanding than either could provide independently.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing technologies to support these arrays can be expensive and difficult to coordinate with the observatories. The need for hands-on experience is seen in fields aiming to achieve extremely high dynamic range such as 21cm cosmology, where progress is limited by systematic effects. Understanding the subtle instrumental effects and finding ways to cope with them – through innovative hardware or software improvements – is needed to unlock the potential of low frequency radio astronomy. This project will build local expertise and capabilities at a predominantly undergraduate institution to support an accessible radio astronomy observatory in the rural Midwest. Three student researchers will be hired each year.  In addition to enhancing their astronomy education, the students will gain a wide array of transferable skills including high performance computing, electronic design, RF testing, system engineering, data analysis, statistics, and algorithmic development. <br/><br/>The Long Wavelength Array (LWA) Swarm is a novel concept to build several radio interferometers across the continent. Each station will operate independently with capabilities to study stellar bursts, pulsars, and the ionosphere. But the real capability of the Swarm is enabled when the stations operate together as a long baseline interferometer. The resulting instrument will have sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies below the FM band, opening opportunities to study magnetic fields of extra-solar planets and resolve the scattering disks of pulsars. Over the course of five years, this project will establish the Midwest Minnesota site for the observatory and perform a variety of demonstrations and experiments that will enhance future proposals to build a larger scale facility. The observatory will provide opportunities for U.S. based researchers to perform ad hoc instrumentation experiments as well as host a station for a continental scale interferometer. Furthermore, the location will add significant value to the point spread function of the LWA Swarm by providing a much-needed North-South baseline and improving sky coverage at high latitudes to open the possibility of continuous observing of the north celestial pole.  A low-barrier testbed site will enable fast development of technologies to progress larger experiments in high-priority science fields, while giving low-cost hands-on field experience to students, particularly undergraduates where research experiences have significant impact on retention and views toward STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While water disinfection protects public health, transformation of PFAs into other potentially toxic chemicals represents an urgent issue. The project explores the reactions between PFAs and common disinfectants such as chlorine and ozone.  The research thus addresses a crucial step in developing more effective water treatment methods and contributing to the overall health of communities nationwide.  More broadly, the project will enhance public understanding of water treatment processes and promote STEM education, offering long-term benefits to society.<br/><br/>The project goal is to determine the transformation mechanisms of PFAS (and their precursors) during conventional drinking water disinfection processes.

Specifically, the project involves controlled laboratory experiments investigating the oxidation of polyfluorinated substances to more persistent perfluoroalkyl compounds under varied conditions.  Effects of bromide ions, natural organic matter, and various disinfectants will be investigated. By integrating experimental results with computational chemistry analyses, the research will unravel the complex interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic factors influencing PFAS precursor transformations.  Additionally, the feasibility of sorptive removal techniques for extracting PFAS precursors from water will be examined, potentially offering a practical remediation strategy.  The project is poised to significantly advance our understanding of PFAS chemical stability and reactivity, thereby informing the development of more effective drinking water treatment solutions.

First, the traditional cross-correlation based search is expected to be 10-40 times more sensitive than the most recent results based on the first three observation runs. Second, for the specific case of the SGWB due to binary black hole mergers, the full Bayesian Search will be developed with the potential to improve the sensitivity by ~1000 times relative to the cross-correlation search. Both searches will be sensitive to the high-redshift population of the compact binary systems, complementing the individual binary merger observations and illuminating the formation and evolution of the binaries.

The behavior of these systems is determined by the individual components and how they interact with each other. Often, the interactions are complex enough to preclude reconstruction of the interaction structure from first-principles. In this proposal we propose to develop data-driven approaches to unravel the interaction structure. However, identification of interaction structure from data poses many challenges that include data collected irregularly in time, unmeasured components, temporal patterns (for example, in the weather) that make data correlated across time, and common physical processes driving the behavior of multiple components. The scientific goal of this project is to devise methods that can correctly identify the links in networks in these challenging, real-world scenarios. <br/><br/>This project will transform the methodology and understanding of network reconstruction by showing how to discover network structures with  realistic data and model conditions, with provable guarantees. Toward reconstruction of interaction structure,  this project will provide results on quantitatively characterizing the accuracy of estimating  power spectral densities with respect to the data-size,  quantitative end-to-end error bounds on the estimation of mutual information rates between time-series, and methods to provably recover exact low-rank/block-sparse decompositions from temporally correlated data, which are of independent interest. The specific innovations for network reconstruction will result in  algorithms with rigorous provable correctness guarantees that are applicable in scenarios with finite data size, linear or nonlinear dynamics, data sampled irregularly in time, unmeasured components, spatial dependencies in driving processes, and statistical non-stationarity. The performance of these methods will be examined in simulations and  on real-world time-series data instantiated with  computational, power, and weather systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motors are everywhere across our societal infrastructure — from transportation and logistics to medical and manufacturing. Uptime, reliability, and energy efficiency are critical concerns. The bearings used in today’s motors limit the performance of the systems and the deployment of more energy efficient technologies. It is estimated that up to 75% of all motor failures are due to bearings. Concerns about further exacerbating bearing lifetime issues often limit the use of variable speed motor drives.  Additionally, current bearing lubrication processes pose contamination hazards for many systems. Decarbonization and electrification efforts have elevated these concerns across many industries, leading to product development of oil-free and contact-free bearings, such as magnetic and gas bearings. However, the commercial success of these products has been limited by cost and/or low performance. This PFI project provides a cost-effective solution by using electromagnetism within the electric motor to create shaft forces. The project initially targets industrial compressor systems but promises to revolutionize the entire motor industry. Successful adaptation will enable a 9% reduction in U.S. electric energy consumption.<br/><br/>The project addresses challenges that must be overcome to realize cost-effective, oil-free machinery through the use of force-capable electric motors. This technology will be demonstrated at a power scale necessary to justify commercial development. To achieve these objectives, the research plan targets (1) scaling design aspects and assumptions of bearingless motors to the high-power levels required of industrial compressors and (2) creating a low-cost, bolt-on set of electronics that can transform a standard electric motor system into a system that will be capable of creating and controlling shaft forces. A key challenge limiting commercialization of this technology is that all available test data has been conducted at low power levels with inadequate energy efficiency for the markets in greatest need of this technology. The project will leverage recent research advancements in combined winding design and control techniques to improve efficiency and enable the use of standard motor system components. The project will use a professional-grade dynamometer to measure the torque-speed-efficiency characteristics of a 100 kW bearingless motor system composed of a standard motor drive, standard motor with a custom winding, and newly developed control electronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These migrants include grey whales, wildebeest, monarch butterflies and sandhill cranes. And just like a family on a long road trip across the country, an animal on its annual migration has to stop and refuel along the way. Although the time spent at these ‘stopover’ sites is relatively short, it is incredibly important. Migrating animals need to rest and regain energy (by feeding on local animals and plants) before continuing their journey. Migrating animals also play an important role for many local plants during these visits. Migrating animals like birds, bats and insects that feed on nectar can move pollen around, helping plants reproduce. And migrating animals that eat fruit can help seeds within those fruits move to new locations. This project aims to understand how visits by migratory animals affect plants at stopover sites. How do visits by migrants affect how fast plant populations can grow and spread locally? And what happens if migrants stop coming? Will the plant populations cope with the change, or will they decline either slowly or rapidly? This project will use computer-based models to understand patterns. Familiarity with computers and how to create computer code can be a barrier to this type of research for students studying biology in college. So as part of this project, researchers will work with a local (St. Paul, MN) elementary school to expand access to computers and computer programming using robots.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers will develop novel mathematical theory to consider both the beneficial services that migrants provide as well as the costs they extract. Each aim will focus on a different type of mutualistic relationship between migratory animals and plants at stopover sites. Aim 1 considers pollination, where migrants consume nectar (reducing energy to plants) while increasing mating (and thus reproduction) through pollen movement.  Aim 2 considers frugivory, where migrants consume fruits (reducing plant fecundity) while increasing germination probability (survival) and dispersal for seeds passed through their guts. Aim 3 considers epizoochory, where migrants consume plants and inadvertently pick up adhesive seeds, thus increasing seed dispersal. The outcome of this research will be predictions as to how sensitive plant population spread is to changes in migratory species and when – if ever – loss of migratory species can promote spread, or even cause population collapse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Iron oxide-associated organic carbon is one of the largest reservoirs of carbon on the Earth’s surface. Predicting changes to the size of soil carbon reservoirs and sustainably managing soil and water quality is an important challenge.  A rigorous understanding of the chemical nature of iron-organic carbon complexes has the potential to assist scientists in this endeavor. So far, the origin and formation mechanism of soil organic carbon in complex with iron remain poorly understood. As a primary precursor for soil organic carbon, plant-derived lignin can be degraded into compounds that may bind to iron oxides. This project aims to uncover the chemical nature of lignin-derived ligands for iron. Soil carbon is an important part of the Earth's carbon cycle, and an element of this cycle that is highly relevant to climate. Graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students will be engaged in this research at both institutions. Leveraging an NSF-funded Innovations in Graduate Education project, a summer camp module will be developed focusing on environmental chemistry relevant to sustainability, to increase the representation of first-generation students and underrepresented groups in graduate studies in science.<br/> <br/>This project sets out to develop targeted and non-targeted methods to detect and quantify lignin-derived ligands and their iron complexes by liquid chromatography together with high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The method will be developed and validated with a set of known lignin degradation products and used to characterize the iron-binding products formed by microbial degradation of lignin in pure culture and soil incubation. It is expected that these studies will help elucidate the chemical nature of biopolymer (lignin)-derived iron ligands and their complexes and provide insights into the chemical mechanisms that fractionate soil organic carbon, ultimately governing soil organic carbon stocks. Such understanding is critical for developing predictive models for the nature and form of soil-constrained organic carbon.

As one of the most common types of bacteria, peritrichous bacteria such as Escherichia coli swim by rotating a single helical bundle, which is formed from multiple flagellar filaments growing all over the bacterial body. This proposal addresses a fundamental question in the fluid dynamics of the swimming of peritrichous bacteria, i.e., how do the multiple flagellar filaments of a bacterium synchronize and rotate collectively to provide a coherent thrust, enabling the swimming of the bacterium? Toward solving this long-standing problem, the project will integrate experiments on macroscopic model flagella with experiments on microscopic living bacteria and state-of-the-art numerical simulations. Through a systematic and iterative approach, the project aims to resolve the underlying fluid-mechanics principles governing the complex dynamics of bacterial flagellar bundles and uncover their effects on bacterial swimming. The project will provide good opportunities for recruiting undergraduate students from a minority-serving college in frontier research and for designing scientific demonstrations on bacterial swimming for outreach activities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the synchronization and collective dynamics of multiple flagella in a bacterial bundle. Particularly, the project aims to reveal how multiple flagella synchronize to form a functioning bundle – an indispensable process for the swimming and chemotaxis of a large class of bacteria – and illustrate the collective dynamics of flagella in the bundle. More specifically, the project will construct the most accurate scale experiments to date with previously unexplored features, which will provide a benchmark to develop an immersed-boundary numerical model for simulating flagellar dynamics at different scales. The predictions of both the scale experiments and numerical simulations will be finally compared with microscopic experiments on real bacteria. More broadly, the work will shed light onto the origin of hydrodynamic synchronization and facilitate the development of engineering techniques for tailoring the synchronized dynamics of micron-sized objects. Beyond the specific scientific and engineering questions, the project will expand the limited toolbox to tackle challenging issues associated with low-Reynolds-number fluid-structure interactions.

Located in the central gyres of the subtropical ocean, these regions are too remote to receive significant nutrient inputs from land or from deeper waters by vertical mixing. The low supply of nutrients should result in reduced levels of photosynthesis and less complex food webs. However, observations instead indicate that life grows at rates similar to regions which receive higher nutrient supplies. Our project seeks to determine what the missing sources of nutrients are that help sustain these ecosystems. This work will focus on nitrogen bound within dissolved organic molecules that are produced in nutrient-rich regions, including coastal California, and then transported laterally to the ‘ocean desert’ of the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. A one-month research expedition will leave from San Diego, CA and end in Honolulu, HI USA to study the production, accumulation, chemical composition, and utilization of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and link it to photosynthesis occurring across the North Pacific. The new knowledge gained about the role of DON in satisfying the nutrient requirements of the subtropical North Pacific will be used to construct computer models that gauge the global importance of this nutrient source to subtropical ocean ecosystems. <br/><br/>Additional nitrogen (N) sources beyond subsurface nitrate (NO3-) and N2 fixation fluxes are required to explain observed net community production (NCP) within subtropical ocean ecosystems. Numerical models indicate that laterally supplied allochthonous DON may support 10-60% of NCP in oligotrophic subtropical gyres, but with large uncertainties. The proposed work will field test hypotheses concerning the biological production and consumption of marine DON, and whether allochthonous DON is a significant organic nutrient source sustaining NCP. A North Pacific cruise will use observations of DON concentration, chlorophyll a concentration, and N isotopes [DON's 15N/14N ratio, and NO3-'s 15N/14N ratio] to identify regions of net DON production and consumption in the context of net and gross biological productivity estimated using O2/Ar and triple Oxygen isotopic measurements, respectively. Novel organic geochemistry tools will be used to identify the molecular composition of the allochthonous DON. The influence of depth on DON consumption will be investigated using ship-board incubations that expose surface DON collected across gradients in surface NO3- to microbial communities from several depth intervals. Finally, a new semi-labile DON tracer will be encoded in a global ocean biogeochemistry model, fashioned to behave like the allochthonous DON characterized from the field observations. The DON and isotopic data sets will serve to constrain model parameterizations of semi-labile DON cycling. The state-of-the-art model of semi-labile DON cycling will be used to quantitatively assess the portion of NCP sustained by allochthonous DON delivery to the North Pacific subtropical gyre and extend this assessment across the global ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes threaten food security and at worst, have the potential to trigger regional famine and civil unrest and are thus a threat to national security. Understanding plant development and stress response processes is crucial to producing crops that are more resilient to increasingly extreme environmental conditions. Small peptides play significant roles in changes during development and stress responses in plants. This project aims to explore the functional role of 20 newly identified small peptides in plant development and response to environmental stressors to identify potential targets for crop improvement. This project will engage undergraduate students in the research process through hands-on experience in a course-based undergraduate research project in Molecular Biology and in more immersive summer research positions at Gustavus Adolphus College and the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University. Additionally, undergraduate students will collaborate to develop and test next-generation science standards-aligned educational modules for K-12 educators on genetics, genetic engineering, and climate impacts on food security.<br/><br/>Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play a significant role in gene expression changes during development and stress responses in plants. Some lincRNAs contain small open reading frames (sORFs) that can encode short peptides, known as sORF-encoded peptides or SEPs, with regulatory functions. Identification of SEPs has been challenging due to their small size and unique gene expression profiles but have recently come to light through ribosomal profiling and mass spectrometry. The current project seeks to target 20 translated SEP loci, for knock-out using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Edited plants will be evaluated using low-cost, high-throughput phenotyping-based approaches to determine the consequences of loss of SEP expression. SEP mutants that display altered growth will be further investigated using genetic and molecular techniques to characterize their role in plant development and stress responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, they are used to describe the orbital paths of satellites. Taking the satellite scenario, for example, a natural question to ask is whether there are recurring orbits that a satellite can traverse. Contact homology offers a systematic way to explore the geometric features of these contact manifolds. In the satellite scenario, one can gain deep insights into all possible orbital paths of satellites by analyzing recurring satellite orbits. Contact homology has been highly successful in distinguishing different contact manifolds. This project aims to refine our understanding of contact manifolds using an enhanced approach based on contact homology. Furthermore, the PI intends to apply the techniques developed in this process to study other types of spaces beyond contact manifolds, such as spaces with symmetries. Symmetries play a crucial role in many aspects of daily life. For instance, ensuring that machine learning models treat people fairly, irrespective of their sex or race, reflects a key symmetry requirement. <br/><br/>Symplectic Field Theory, introduced two decades ago, aims to provide invariants for symplectic and contact manifolds. It encompasses essential concepts such as cylindrical contact homology, contact homology, chain homotopy types of contact differential graded algebras (dga), and linearized contact homology. The projects presented here revolve around the foundational aspects of Symplectic Field Theory. The primary challenge addressed by the Principal Investigator (PI) concerns achieving transversality while preserving symmetries to derive the desired algebraic formula. Various tools and techniques, including obstruction bundle gluing and evaluation maps for cylindrical contact homology, and semi-global Kuranishi structures for contact homology, have been introduced or employed by the PI. The project applies these tools to investigate two specific invariants: the chain homotopy type of contact dga and linearized contact homology. Furthermore, the PI has developed a new tool, the semi-global Kuranishi structure for clean intersections, which lies between obstruction bundle gluing and semi-global Kuranishi structures. This tool offers increased computational efficiency and bridges seemingly unrelated techniques. The project also aims to establish a Smith-type rank inequality related to the Floer homology of the fixed point set, contributing to the understanding of the L-space conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research focuses on part of the element cycling system: where tectonic plates sink (subduct) into the Earth and heat up, driving chemical reactions among minerals. The reactions release water and other elements. These become part of the continents, atmosphere, and oceans. The research aims to determine the conditions of the reactions. Reactions involving iron, oxygen, water, and other elements affect the planet's composition, and these reactions also affect the planet's habitability. This project uses rocks from places where subducted rocks are at the Earth’s surface. It will determine the composition of two minerals: epidote and lawsonite which contain iron and water. The motivation for the research is the unexpected finding of differences in the state of iron in these minerals and the need to understand the causes and extent of this variation. Two graduate students will be involved (one PhD, one MS) at the University of Minnesota and they will collaborate with scientists in Germany, Australia, and India. The results of mineral analyses in this project add an important dimension to community geochemical datasets.<br/><br/>Lawsonite and epidote are abundant minerals in subducted oceanic crust; both are hydrous Ca-Al silicates that carry water and other elements from shallow to deep levels of the planet via subduction. Lawsonite forms under very low thermal gradient conditions and commonly transforms to epidote-group minerals (EGMs) as a result of an increase in temperature during subduction and/or exhumation. This research is based on two key observations: (1) The composition of lawsonite is a sensitive indicator of fluid sources: oxygen isotope values and trace element content (Cr, V, Sr, Pb) signal mantle (serpentinite) vs. sediment as contributors to fluids that participated in lawsonite-forming reactions; and (2) Although commonly assumed to contain only ferric iron (Fe3+), analysis using X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) has detected substantial ferrous iron (Fe2+) in lawsonite and epidote in high-pressure rocks (blueschists and eclogites), raising questions of what controls the oxidation state of Fe in subducted oceanic crust (pre-subduction rock composition or syn-subduction fluid-rock interaction), whether there are systematic changes as a function of temperature/depth, and whether Fe oxidation state correlates with indicators of fluid sources. This research addresses these questions with an investigation of lawsonite and epidote major, trace, and oxygen isotope composition and Fe oxidation state in rocks recording different pressure-temperature conditions (blueschist, eclogite) and chemical environments (proximity to serpentinite, sediments). The new dataset is a contribution to understanding controls on mineral composition and Fe oxidation state in hydrous minerals in relation to fluid sources and pressure-temperature conditions. Results are relevant to understanding the contributions of oxidizing and reducing sources of fluids that influence subducted plates and subsequently the overlying mantle and, ultimately, continents and volcanic arcs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is often assumed that chorus and hiss are well-separated by a sharp density gradient boundary called the plasmapause, with all hiss occurring on one side of the plasmapause and all chorus occurring on the other.  This assumption has a problem: around half of the time, the plasmapause boundary is ill-defined, and is observed as less of a boundary, but more of a transition region. When this occurs, chorus and hiss can co-occur and overlap spatially, meaning particles may feel the combined effect of both wave types simultaneously. This project will characterize wave properties in these transition regions and establish the impact of the transition region on radiation belt simulations. This project will also support students and researchers from a teaching-focused college to actively participate in geospace science research.<br/><br/>The investigation will first focus on cases where the plasmapause density gradient is not sharp (e.g., spans up to several L-shell), seeking to determine whistler-mode wave properties in the plasmasphere-plasmatrough transition region when a well-defined plasmapause may not exist (i.e., soft plasmapause). Data collected during these intervals are often excluded from statistical studies, which has led to wave property databases being built only from time periods when the plasmapause is a sharp, well-defined density gradient (i.e., hard plasmapause). This usually occurs during elevated geomagnetic activity, when waves are more intense, thus biasing predictive radiation belt models towards stronger wave-particle interaction processes. The team will construct full statistical hiss and chorus wave models for both the ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ plasmapause cases. This will be the first time that the characteristics and role of whistler-mode waves in spatially broad plasmasphere-plasmatrough transition regions has been directly investigated. The results will supply radiation belt modelers with the critical information of wave properties in the often-excluded case of ‘soft’ plasmapause transition regions (which account for ~50% of occurrences).  This will improve the dynamical determination of acceleration and scattering regions in the radiation belts by removing bias towards plasmapauses defined by steep density gradients, and the extreme separation of hiss and chorus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the most useful form of hydrogen, H2, is not abundant and instead hydrogen atoms are mostly found bonded to other elements, such as to carbon in hydrocarbons or to oxygen in water. Currently, 95% of the global H2 supply is produced by transforming methane from natural gas via the steam-methane reforming reaction that produces 5.5 tons CO2 per ton of H2. Electron-driven chemical reactions harnessing renewable electricity to produce H2 would be transformative for clean energy technology in the 21st century. While water electrolysis can leverage renewable energy for H2 production, producing H2 directly from methane is much less energy intensive and can lead to the co-production of high-value carbon materials, which would significantly decrease the cost of hydrogen. This research effort examines the scientific principles underlying a new approach to produce H2 as a carbon-free energy carrier from methane—a distributed and economically-essential asset in the U.S.—with no CO2 emissions. The process concurrently produces carbon fibers, versatile structural materials with applications ranging from civil infrastructure to consumer products. The project will involve interdisciplinary education and training of a post-doctoral researcher, and doctoral and undergraduate students. Outreaching activities will include the promotion of STEM careers to underrepresented minorities, organization of the 2025 US Low Temperature Plasma School and documenting best practices for design and operation of lab scale plasma reactors. <br/><br/>This project will provide key insights into chemical and physical rate processes and into fluid flow configurations to support the creation of electricity-driven plasma-catalytic process using microwave excitation with efficiencies exceeding electrolysis, to make carbon-free hydrogen and solid carbon fibers from natural gas. The project’s approach will leverage the highly selective nature of catalytic processes on surfaces and non-equilibrium electron-induced plasma reactions to enable catalytic chemistry at conditions far from equilibrium. This project will evaluate the hypothesis that interfacing microwave plasma with catalysts enables the suppression of unselective gas phase recombination and nucleation in favor of selective surface recombination reactions towards carbon fibers. This means controlling recombination chemistry on timescales of radical lifetimes which are likely in the order of 100 microseconds or less. The activation of strong C-H bonds in methane will significantly enhance the rate and conversion of methane pyrolysis at a volumetric scale in the gas phase but these short-lived plasma-derived intermediates must be transported to the two-dimensional catalytic surface. Thus, the interaction of plasmas with catalytic surfaces for methane pyrolysis involves time and length-scales that span orders of magnitudes and involve flux and reactivity of both short-lived intermediates as well as solid state nucleation and growth phenomena. This research will integrate in-situ diagnostics, catalyst science, and computational modeling to identify and understand physical phenomena at reaction and transport time and length scales appropriate to describe and facilitate plasma-catalyst interactions for methane pyrolysis to produce H2 and carbon fibers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EEP is one of the main processes contributing to the loss of energetic electrons and has important implications in the interconnected atmosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system (e.g., changes in atmospheric chemistry, ionization, and conductance) and in space weather (e.g., satellite radiation monitoring, satellite drag, etc.).  These energetic electrons are primarily scattered by plasma waves; however, due to limited data coverage, our comprehensive understanding of EEP is limited.  In this project, by developing a machine learning (ML) model, the team will characterize and parameterize the EEP phenomenon's properties and dynamics. Modeling the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmospheric system. The project is highly interdisciplinary, as our understanding of EEP directly impacts several fields, from the atmosphere and ionosphere system to the magnetosphere, and even potentially provides helpful information for space weather monitoring of electron radiation in the near-Earth environment. The project has the potential to support collaborative efforts across all these communities. The ML model and its outputs will be released to the public, enabling follow-up research projects.<br/><br/>The lack of global observations of EEP is a major limiting factor in advancing our knowledge on EEP. The team suggest to parameterize EEP by developing global EEP maps through the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. These maps will be based on measurements from the long-lived NOAA's POES/MetOp satellites and will be produced given a time history of geomagnetic activity. The project will address the following science questions: How does the global electron precipitation evolve in time and space with geomagnetic activity? Which plasma waves correspond to the observed enhanced electron precipitation? How does the improved spatial coverage impact the estimates/constraints on the spatial size, duration, and flux intensity of the electron precipitation regions? Analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of regions where EEP occurs will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of the radiation belt dynamics and temporal dependence of the energy input to the atmosphere. Additionally, the team will explore whether there is a clear cause-effect correlation between the location and energy of EEP and two main plasma waves. This provides a more definite understanding of the causal relationship between the wave modes and EEP, possibly demonstrating that EEP maps can serve as a proxy for wave activity.  Finally, by estimating the size and flux of EEP regions, the team will quantify the electron loss of the outer radiation belt and the EEP input that contributes to variations in atmospheric chemistry and ionization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As an energy carrier that cuts across sectors, natural geologic hydrogen could serve as a future clean energy source. This project focuses on the exploration and characterization of new hydrogen resources in the United States, and innovative education and workforce developments to meet the demand for future careers in clean energy. The researchers build a model for hydrogen generation potential from iron-rich rocks by identifying hydrogen-producing reactions, testing their geographic extent, and building a scalable workflow for hydrogen resource exploration. To expand clean energy education experiences and contribute to workforce development, the researchers will create introductory experiential learning opportunities focused on the role of Earth science in clean energy futures and will expand upper level undergraduate research opportunities through course-based research relating to hydrogen as a future energy source. Additionally, team will facilitate discussions between academia and industry through a clean energy symposium, and will connect students to employers for on-the-job training in sustainable geoscience research, thereby providing students with training for future clean energy careers.<br/><br/>The project identifies and characterizes new natural hydrogen resources in the United States and gauges the natural hydrogen production potential of iron-rich rocks. This is the first-time natural hydrogen generation through low temperature oxidation reactions is practically tested in iron-rich geologic units in the United States. Quantification of hydrogen-producing reactions in iron-rich rocks in drill cores from across the mid-continent of the United States requires application of a multi-method, multi-scale workflow. The researchers quantify hydrogen generation potential of iron-rich rocks by calculating the total reduced iron remaining in the rock unit that has the capacity to react with subsurface fluids which requires (1) determination of mineral oxidation reactions, mineral volumes, and iron valency; (2) measurement of oxidation-reduction potential of regional subsurface fluids in direct contact with iron-rich rocks, (3) direct measurement of hydrogen gas in boreholes that intersect iron-rich rocks; and (4) identification of microbial hydrogen consumption. Subsequent tasks involve mapping of gas and fluid migration paths to quantify regional hydrogen transport and storage and determining regional trap and seal potential through application of geospatial and geophysical data analysis. The research provides foundational datasets required to systematically assess the potential for large-scale domestic hydrogen production and usage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metadata contains information about a dataset, which may include what kind of data it is, how it was created, and technical information about the data relevant to how it can be used. Effective community-required metadata enables the data products of individual research efforts to be used by other investigators beyond those that created the data and the public as well. This project comes in response to the memorandum issued on August 25, 2022, by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The OSTP memo tasks federal funding agencies to “develop strategies to make federally funded publications, data, and other such research outputs and their metadata findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable, to the American public and the scientific community in an equitable and secure manner.” A good CMS metadata standard also enables meaningful data sharing that can advance materials research generally and supports the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). MGI seeks to accelerate and sustain the process from materials discovery to deployment in products, so that the process takes place in half the time and a fraction of the cost. This would be enabled in part by developing advanced infrastructure for computation, experiment, and data, and innovative ways to combine computation, experiment, and data-centric approaches including machine learning. A second goal is to promote reproducibility in CMS by enabling others to regenerate datasets. The MatCore Standard includes a required minimal set of metadata that would accompany all CMS datasets, and additional optional metadata specific to particular CMS techniques.<br/><br/>Development of the MatCore Standard involves the determination of what information regarding a CMS dataset must be recorded, and in what form, to make it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), and ideally reproducible. This requires a careful assessment within each CMS domain regarding the nature of the scientific computation that was performed to generate the data. Understanding of this type lies at the heart of the fundamental principle of the scientific method that scientific research must be repeatable. An extensive review will be carried out to identify previous work on characterizing CMS datasets with the intent to build on existing approaches and standards wherever possible.<br/><br/>This project will stimulate discussion in the materials community. Conference and town hall style activities are included for community input to be incorporated into the released MatCore standard. If the result of this project is broadly adopted, it will affect virtually all aspects of CMS, which can contribute to a wide range of technologically and socially important domains. The development of the MatCore Standard may help researchers to build rapidly and effectively on each other’s work and may make materials science more equitable by providing easy and equal access to everyone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These phases, such as ""high temperature"" superconductivity, hold exciting potential for technological applications such as creating a scalable quantum computer. Recently discovered ""moiré"" materials, formed by stacking 2D materials with a relative twist, hold unique promise as platforms for investigation of such phases. The investigator is tackling open mathematical problems with direct relevance to understanding the emergence and properties of strongly correlated electronic phases in moiré materials. By tackling these problems, the investigator is helping to advance novel technologies and strengthening connections between mathematics, physics and engineering. The investigator is training University of Minnesota graduate students in core techniques in applied mathematics and expanding awareness of exciting modern topics in applied mathematics through outreach to middle and high school students in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.<br/><br/>In preliminary work, the investigator justified the Bistritzer-MacDonald continuum PDE model for the wave-function of an electron in twisted bilayer graphene. The importance of this model is that, even though the underlying atomic-scale model is aperiodic, the continuum model has moiré-periodic coefficients, allowing the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene to be studied using Bloch theory. The research project is building on this work, with the ultimate goal of developing mathematical methods for predicting moiré materials' strongly correlated electronic phases. In the near term, the project will build directly on the investigator's preliminary work. First, generalizing it to more realistic models incorporating atomic relaxation, and to models of other moiré materials. Second, analytically investigating important properties of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model such as Dirac point degeneracies and band topology. Over the medium term, the project will build on the insights gained from earlier work to develop and justify more accurate models of mechanical properties of moiré materials such as atomic relaxation and vibration (phonons). Two approaches will be investigated: a phenomenological continuum approach, and an atomic-scale approach where ions interact through interatomic potentials. Over the long term, the project will again build on earlier insights to develop models of electrons interacting in moiré materials. In the first of these, electrons will interact directly through the Coulomb force. In the second, the electron-electron interaction will be mediated by a phonon. Mathematically, the project involves rigorous asymptotic analysis and perturbation theory, PDE theory, spectral theory, calculus of variations, and ergodic theory. The project draws new connections between these areas and the application area in materials science. The research will develop these areas by introducing new problems and insights. While accomplishing the research goals of the project, the investigator is training University of Minnesota graduate students in core techniques in applied mathematics.

PHY rateless codes have the innate ability to adapt both the code construction and the number of code bits for an as-need basis incremental transmission of code bits. The constituent code of link adaptation technology in the PHY layer works with the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocols in the data link layer. The Phase II project designs innovations for the component encoders and decoders of the PHY layer rateless codes such as designing a GRAND (Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding) decoder for the LT codes, investigating the variable node degree design for the tradeoff between waterfall and error floor performance, pairing probabilistic amplitude shaping with PHY layer rateless codes and concatenation with CRC for maximizing the minimum Hamming distance for short block length performance. New design features based on deep learning/AI enhancements, structured permutations, and techniques for optimizing the LT code degree distributions will be added to the PHY rateless encoder and decoder. The expected technical results include patented designs for encoder, decoder, and the related software in Matlab/Python for the blocks of a `FutureG’ baseband modem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While progress has been made on resonant-beam based wireless charging, high-data-rate communication through the resonant-beam channel remains largely unexplored. The unique channel characteristics pose grand challenges due to the inherent nonlinearity of the lasing mechanism, and the large delay spread emerging from the oscillatory signaling operation. The project will pursue channel modelling and transceiver designs through both model-based and data-driven learning approaches and will also develop an experimental testbed for performance evaluation. Thanks to the promise of data communication through the “wireless fiber” link, and the fact that there is no interference to and from coexisting radio devices, the technology developed in this project will find emerging “killer applications” requiring high data rate and ultra-low-latency latency such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Advances from this project will contribute to smart homes, smart hospitals, and smart manufacturing, and will make a profound impact to the society. This project will educate undergraduate and graduate students, improve the participation of under-represented groups, and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>The resonant beam channel is distinct from all channels investigated so far, including wireless infrared, visible light, radio channels including millimeter Wave and TeraHz. The transformative research is performed along three intertwined thrusts.  (i) Self-driven nonlinear and time-varying Volterra series along with (multi-) kernel generalizations will be explored for nonlinear channel modelling and learning, for both the downlink and the uplink between the access point and the user equipment or sensors;  (ii) Transceiver designs will start with legacy waveforms on-off-keying (OOK) and orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) for resilience to the nonlinearity and large-delay spread of the resonant beam channel.  Novel end-to-end signal designs will be further investigated through artificial-intelligence (AI) tools; and (iii) Distinct optical designs with the inclusion of an adaptive optical element such as a spatial light modulator (SLM) will be pursued, which allows the system to scale to multiple users/clients, compensate for environmental disturbances, and support information transfer.  Experimental data will be collected to support algorithm design, and performance validation. Investigation of this uncharted territory will leverage interdisciplinary approaches at the confluence of optical engineering, wireless communications, signal processing, and statistical learning. Novel channel models and signaling waveforms will be delivered to enrich the toolbox of wireless communications and signal processing with algorithms and the corresponding state-of-the-art communication prototypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indigenous people used fire for centuries to not only ensure ample supplies of important resources, such as food and fiber materials, but also to connect with the land. European colonization changed the close connections between Indigenous people and fire. Today, many land management agencies use prescribed fire to achieve several goals, but these efforts often have limited cultural value for Tribal communities. This project first seeks to understand the cultural context of burning in Indigenous lands and what Indigenous peoples aim to achieve in terms of both ecological and cultural objectives. In developing this research the project provides knowledge, training, and resources to conduct culturally-meaningful burns that are safe and effective. Strong connections with the Tallgrass Prairie and Oak Savanna Fire Science Consortium and the USDA Agricultural Research Service ensure broad dissemination and use by a large stakeholder community in the region.<br/><br/>Many Indigenous communities believe regaining control of fire in their landscapes will help heal damage passed down from generation to generation. This project develops capacity for underrepresented communities in the Upper Midwest to understand and implement cultural burning themselves. Specifically, listening sessions with elders and land managers in Indigenous communities aim to inform what is currently known and practiced with respect to cultural burning across the upper Midwest, and identify barriers, knowledge gaps, and under-developed opportunities that currently limit cultural burning. Following the listening sessions, common themes are presented to a focus group of regional Indigenous stakeholders to identify priorities for education and training to be addressed in subsequent phases of the Fire as Medicine project. The team facilitates the development of an Indigenous model of fire regimes based on Traditional Ecological Knowledge for the prairies and woodlands of the Upper Midwest and adjacent regions in Canada.

The effect of roughness is very challenging to simulate rigorously because the geometry and the nearby velocity field has to be reproduced with a very fine resolution, which is computationally expensive. For some applications, including wind energy, pollution dispersion, canopy flows in urban areas, the ground region is a minor, but unfortunately necessary and costly, component of the simulation. The standard approach is to bypass the complexity of the roughness layer and assume that the logarithmic mean velocity profile extends all the way to the surface, thus losing some of the variability of the near surface velocity field. A more active wall modeling strategy could be envisioned. Recently, the evolution and derivation of the logarithmic mean velocity profile, has been connected to the vertical distribution of Uniform Momentum Zones. These are large flow regions that tend to move coherently with the same velocity, tend to get thicker with the distance from the wall, and are separated by thin regions of intense gradients. The Uniform Momentum Zones, and these internal shear layers separating them, are the simplest modeling framework for wall turbulence. The outreach component of the proposal includes a summer program for undergrad students from Native American Tribal College, international collaboration with a colleague in Australia, and experimental data sharing, open to everyone in the research community. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to formulate, and validate experimentally, a Uniform Momentum Zones-based stochastic model able to reproduce the velocity field, characteristic of near-surface turbulence, preserving its variability and dynamics, all the way to the ground.  To build and test this new model, experiments are needed, on different rough surfaces, to map the Uniform Momentum Zones distribution in three dimensions and guide the stochastic model. A new interface with large scale numerical simulations will be also implemented as a new, dynamic boundary condition. This will enable researchers to replace the computationally expensive, near-surface domain with an affordable synthetic velocity field, and improve future simulations of complex atmospheric flows, or similarly high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers, like those developing around ships or planes. The ultimate goal is to enable and test the formulation of the stochastic model based on the surface roughness geometry and on easily measurable flow variables, to ensure predictive capabilities with minimal input information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently the food animal market relies mostly on central laboratories for their diagnostic needs. The most common concerns faced by the stakeholders in the food animal market are diagnostic time and the cost of the tests, limiting the number and the frequency of tests that could be performed for regulation of animal health. A magnetic particle spectroscopy-based diagnostic platform can enable rapid detection of pathogen(s) at the farm.  Such pathogen detection is essential for the efficient implementation of control strategies that curtail disease outbreaks in animal production systems. In addition, the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single test, enabled by the new detection capabilities would further aid in reducing the time of intervention, effort, and cost of production for farmers dealing with these diseases. This assay can be readily modified for the detection of different diseases, enabling the platform to be utilized for the diagnosis of both human as well as animal diseases. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of rapid diagnostic tests built upon magnetic particle spectroscopy. the magnetic particle spectroscopic assay utilizes antibody- or ligand-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles for the detection of biomarkers of interest. As the biological matrices are non-magnetic / weakly diamagnetic, magnetic particle spectroscopy has an advantage over other commonly used optical or fluorescence-based detection methods in reducing the signal to noise ratio. Thus, the magnetic particle spectroscopy-based assay is highly accurate, and capable of delivering multiplexed test results. The diagnostic feasibility of this assay was tested using influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The portability of the detection device coupled with a smartphone interface will allow testing in remote areas and under field settings, such as on a farm or in a production system. By transmitting test results collected from distant locations to centrally located data analysis units, remotely located veterinarians can receive real-time epidemiological data. This data would also significantly reduce the costs of monitoring infections at the regional level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This complex mixture plays key roles within aquatic ecosystems. DOM is a source of nutrients and food for microbes. It acts as a sunscreen in surface waters by reducing ultraviolet radiation. It can also bind trace metals, changing their bioavailability and toxicity. The chemical structure of DOM determines both its ecological roles and its environmental fate. Microbial uptake and respiration and degradation by sunlight are key processes that transform DOM, leading to its eventual oxidation to carbon dioxide. Another key factor in DOM fate is the presence of salt. Salt ions can react with sunlight; the resulting products can alter DOM structures. This project will investigate the role of salt in photochemical reactions. Experiments will be done where salt and sunlight will be added to freshwater samples with high concentrations of brown, land-derived DOM and freshwater samples with relatively clear lake-derived DOM. The study will measure DOM loss and changes in DOM chemical structure. These results will be compared with studies of the original freshwater and samples collected along a river to marine transect. Many inland waters are becoming saltier due to land use changes, road salt use, and climate change. Many coastal waters are undergoing high variability in salt levels due to major storm events like hurricanes. Results from this study will help predict DOM effects on algal growth, trace metal binding, energy for food webs, and interactions with man-made chemicals.  This project will provide training opportunities for students; results will be shared with both the scientific community and the public.<br/><br/>DOM in aquatic systems plays key environmental roles. These roles are largely a function of DOM chemical structure, with carboxyl groups in DOM being important in energy transfer in biota, trace metal chelation, and interactions with organic pollutants. The effects of salinity on photochemical changes to DOM structure, including carboxylation and decarboxylation, are, however, surprisingly unconstrained. These salinity effects are important to address now, as climate change is altering the salinity of inland and coastal marine systems. We will investigate DOM photochemistry using a freshwater transect (St. Louis River to Lake Superior) that includes sites varying in DOM source (land plants vs phytoplankton) and structure (more aromatic vs more aliphatic). These samples can be amended with salts of various concentrations and major ion compositions. Thus we can tease apart the roles of ionic strength (how much salt) from the specific effects of halide radical formation (what kinds of salts are present). We will compare these experimental results with photochemical studies on a natural freshwater to saltwater transect (Penobscot River to Gulf of Maine) at a similar latitude and with similar upstream land use patterns. Understanding salinity’s effects on DOM photochemical transformations will be a key step in predicting the effects of climate change on DOM’s environmental roles in aquatic systems. This project includes training opportunities for two graduate students and four undergraduate students. Project results will be shared through presentations and peer-reviewed publications and via Science on Deck research vessel tours and the Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is proposed to design environmentally safe synthetic biofilm consortia that can be incorporated into a bioreactor system for the efficient biodegradation of model polyfluorinated compounds known as PFAS that accumulate in the environment and are of increasing health and environmental concern and regulatory focus. Specifically, this project will (1) learn to design and control the formation of a robust artificial biofilm consortia composed of two bacterial species for (2) the efficient degradation of PFAS compounds that will be implemented on an easy to configure and cost-effective biofilm carrier system for future bioreactor operations (3). Molecular mechanisms will be interrogated and identified with which to manipulate the composition and properties of biofilms composed of engineered bacteria that are not typically associated with each other. Targeting PFAS degradation will create new innovative biocatalytic activities for the degradation of hard to biodegrade moieties that are recalcitrant funnel points of heavily used commercial agrichemicals and pharmaceuticals that enter our waterways. Knowledge and systems generated in this project will enable the design of new living biofilm materials for potentially transformational biotechnology processes beyond bioremediation, such as for biomanufacturing, energy and biomedical applications and as functional and/or responsive coatings. Education and outreach activities will be developed to broaden STEM participation and educate the public about biotechnological approaches and the use of genetically engineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For decades it has been observed that ultra-low frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves in the Pc 1-2 frequency range (0.1-5 Hz) near the ion cyclotron frequency are a prominent feature of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  These waves play an important role in heating ionospheric ions to magnetospheric energies, regulating pressure anisotropy in the magnetosphere, populating the magnetosphere with energetic heavy ions during substorms, and inducing enhanced protons.  EMIC waves are known to be excited as left-hand polarized waves near the magnetic equator in the inner magnetosphere and reach the ground propagating along the magnetic field line.  Higher-frequency EMIC waves are often filtered during wave propagation to the ground, while lower-frequency EMIC waves can effectively reach the ground.  Understanding this phenomenon is complicated because EMIC waves can be affected by various physical processes, the plasma environment along the propagation path in the magnetosphere/ionosphere, and wave properties.  The team proposed to understand better the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves using models and both space and ground-based observations.  This collaborative research project consists of scientists from four institutes, including two non-R1 colleges. <br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the propagation and dissipation of EMIC waves in the magnetosphere and ionosphere by answering these four scientific questions:  <br/>1. How do EMIC waves reach the ground?<br/>2. How is EMIC wave propagation affected by geomagnetic activity?<br/>3. How does geomagnetic field topology, such as compressed and stretched magnetic field, affect wave propagation?<br/>4. What is the significance of EMIC wave polarization in the context of the above parameters and how are wave polarizations related with propagation?<br/><br/>The team will employ a state-of-art full-wave simulation code, Petra-M, which uses the finite element method (FEM).  One advantage of using the FEM is that various magnetic field topologies and background plasma parameters are easily adopted in the simulation code.  The Petra-M code will utilize realistic terrestrial magnetic field topologies (dipole and compressed magnetic field) and density configurations from empirical density models.  Wave simulations will be performed to examine wave generation and propagation.  The team will also analyze recent observations of these waves by multiple satellites and compare them with the ground magnetometer network observations.  To consider the EMIC wave propagation in the inner magnetosphere, the proposers will investigate the following characteristics of the EMIC wave events between space (GOES satellite) and ground, spatial distribution (L and MLT), relationship with solar and geomagnetic activity, the distance between GOES satellites and plasmapause locations, and wave properties such as polarization, frequency, and normal angle.  For the EMIC waves in the outer magnetosphere, the team will also investigate space (MMS, THEMIS, and Cluster)-ground conjugate observations using high-latitude ground stations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the next two decades, hundreds of billions of dollars will be invested in the repair and enhancement of wastewater, stormwater, and combined sewer systems to address challenges arising from urbanization and climate change in the United States. This infrastructure is “leaky” and, therefore, interacts with the surrounding soils and the water cycle. However, the associated hydrologic processes, i.e., subsurface flows of drinking water, stormwater, and groundwater, are often overlooked or insufficiently characterized in urban watershed studies. Do leaky sanitary and storm sewers recharge or discharge water from the watershed? How will a shift from gray to green stormwater infrastructure impact stormwater retention in watersheds with leaky sewers underneath? Addressing the lack of fundamental scientific knowledge on how urban water infrastructure affects surface-subsurface hydrologic processes is imperative to making effective and resilient water infrastructure investments. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effect of urban soil profiles and water distribution and collection infrastructure on urban water balances, improve urban hydrologic models to better quantify the costs and benefits of infrastructure rehabilitation, and ultimately contribute to the goal of developing resilient and reliable urban water systems. The project will provide an efficient modeling tool to the urban drainage and hydrology community, enhance industry-research collaboration in drainage and water resources in the Midwest, and develop an “Urban Hydrology and Stormwater Management” curriculum that is available to undergraduate and graduate students across the University of Minnesota campuses.<br/><br/>The sustainability and resilience of urban water systems is limited by poor understanding of subsurface hydrologic processes that control flood generation and how they are impacted by urban soil profiles and water distribution and collection infrastructure. These subsurface flows of drinking water, stormwater, wastewater, and groundwater are less characterized in most hydrologic studies and urban hydrologic models. Therefore, there is an urgent need to quantify subsurface hydrologic processes and their interaction with surface infiltration-runoff partitioning in urban watersheds. This project will quantify the effects of urban soil profiles and water distribution and collection infrastructure on event-scale runoff generation and longterm water balances. This will be achieved by integrating soil profile surveys with hydrologic model simulations. First, this work will characterize the soil profiles near water distribution and collection system pipes through soil core sampling and hydraulic profiling. Then, this work will develop a surface-subsurface hydrologic model parameterization that can represent infiltration and exfiltration fluxes between water infrastructure and the unsaturated/saturated zones. Lastly, this work will evaluate the relative effects of soil profiles and sewer pipe conditions and layouts on flood response and long-term water balances through hypothetical simulations at lot and catchment scales. This study focuses on urban watersheds in Milwaukee, WI, while the approach and results are applicable across other urban watersheds in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Cyberinfrastructure Leadership Academy (CILA) brings together senior and emerging CI leaders, to provide valuable mentoring and peer-mentoring opportunities, with the goal of preparing emerging CI leaders to take on national and institutional CI leadership roles. This workshop’s objective is to build on the success of previous CILA workshops, focusing specifically on CI leadership for team science, especially grand challenge projects such as NSF’s 10 Big Ideas. This workshop’s goals are (1) to prepare mid-career emerging CI leaders to take on national CI leadership, particularly team science and grand challenge CI leadership, and (2) to mentor CI leaders from traditionally underrepresented populations and institutions. Support for a diverse group of mid-career leaders will bolster career development and networking opportunities aimed at reducing attrition and broadening the pipeline of future CI senior leadership.<br/><br/><br/>The CILA workshop addresses key needs for a critical stage in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) research CI workforce pipeline, the development of senior CI leaders. This workshop is particularly timely given that longstanding national CI leaders are retiring without a clear pool of successors or pathway of succession for under-represented talent. The burgeoning computing and data-intensive research community depends heavily on senior CI leaders, not only to oversee research CI design, development, implementation, and facilitation, but also to shape the research CI ecosystem and agenda, both locally at their own institutions and especially nationally. Crucial to surviving this expertise drain is capturing as much of that expertise as possible before it is irretrievably lost. A valuable mechanism for this is to establish mentoring relationships between senior CI leaders and emerging mid-career CI leaders, because these relationships not only will enable the transfer of knowledge, experience, and wisdom, but also will solidify the ability of the emerging CI leaders to continue to draw on the expertise of the senior CI leaders even after they retire. By co-locating this workshop with a Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC) meeting, participating emerging CI leaders will have an expanded opportunity for peer-mentoring, because CASC serves as the de facto professional society for institutional CI leaders. CASC has committed to accept all CILA workshop participants who are non-CASC members as guests for the associated CASC meeting, at no registration charge. This workshop grant covers the travel expenses of a cohort, for both this workshop and the associated CASC meeting. CASC provides opportunities both to sustain these activities and to broaden their impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by identifying classroom practices that enable a greater number of students to thrive in these courses.  Whether or not a person completes a four-year undergraduate degree is a primary driver of income levels.  Thus, barriers to earning degrees can present significant obstacles to socioeconomic mobility in the United States.  One such barrier is successful completion of introductory STEM courses.  Persistence in these courses varies even in STEM disciplines in which students from under-represented groups enter the major at the same rates as their majority peers.  Persistence of students is affected by how their instructors teach.  For example, incorporating active learning methods in introductory STEM courses can increase student achievement and lower performance gaps. However, not all implementations of active learning are equally effective for supporting these outcomes. A meta-analysis of over 46,000 students in a wide array of STEM courses compared student outcomes in lecture-based versus active learning classrooms.  Active learning reduced achievement gaps in exam scores by an average of 40% and the gap in failure rates by 75%. Surprisingly, some active learning interventions widened achievement gaps, raising questions about why the variation exists.  Findings from the literature point to two complementary elements of the classroom experience that are necessary to close achievement gaps: (1) an inclusive environment where all students believe they can be successful, which primes them to meaningfully engage; and (2) active learning that follows best practices for how people learn.  This project team aims to identify and test the impact of specific elements of classroom culture and course design that effectively narrow achievement gaps.<br/><br/>This project has three aims: (1) Generate an explanatory model of achievement gaps by identifying and measuring a set of critical elements for closing these gaps in 12 courses identified in a meta-analysis that either narrowed or widened achievement gaps; (2) Establish generalizability of critical elements on achievement gaps by training and validating a predictive model on a national sample of 40 additional introductory courses from a wide array of institution types; (3) Develop, evaluate, and promote a Practitioner’s Toolkit for Closing Achievement Gaps.  This Toolkit will include instructor and student questionnaires that feed directly to a data processing application that fits the predictive model for unique classrooms. In addition, the Toolkit will include self-reflection activities to promote engagement with the personalized results of the predictive model and a guidebook for improvement that explains implementation of each critical element.  Thus, this project intends to produce a novel set of tools that instructors can use to enhance student performance in higher education, helping to make a four-year degree attainable by all students.  The tools developed by the project will be freely available online and disseminated through invited seminars, workshops, and presentations at national meetings.

The timing and amount of these rains are projected to change substantially under anthropogenic climate change. Studying past intervals of global warmth can inform the scientific community and general public on the direction and magnitude of change in EAM characteristics as the planet warms and cools. This project aims to leverage a large archive of fossil soil (paleosol) samples collected from the Baringo Basin of Kenya, Africa, to reconstruct aspects of past hydroclimate and temperature during the Pliocene-Pleistocene epochs (~4.1-2.6 million years ago). This work will produce the first quantitative estimates of precipitation and temperature across intervals of warming and cooling, including the last time that atmospheric CO2 reached current levels. The response of vegetation to these climate changes will be also be documented, thereby informing the scientific community on the sensitivity of different plant groups to changes in climate parameters. This work will support a large cohort of undergraduate student researchers and a PhD student, and scientific results will be incorporated into upper level, data-driven geoscience courses.<br/><br/>Paleosols were previously described in the field in the vicinity of a coring locality associated with the Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project. New analyses will include reconstructing paleoclimate (rainfall, temperature) using robust, multivariate models based on paleosol bulk geochemistry as well as the clumped isotope composition of pedogenic carbonates; vegetation will be reconstructed using stable isotopes from pedogenic carbonates and organic matter. This work will provide the first quantitative paleoclimate estimates from the Baringo Basin, which contains the most continuous Neogene stratigraphic record in equatorial eastern Africa and preserves a rich paleontological and paleoanthropological archive. The results of this work will be placed within an existing, high-resolution geochronologic framework to test hypotheses that relate the effect of CO2 rise to EAM strength, local climate seasonality, and landscape-scale vegetation structure. The project will include outcrop-to-core comparisons to evaluate proxy robustness, thereby strengthening paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental interpretations. The multi-proxy approach will allow for rigorous testing of proxy robustness and repeatability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants infected by pests or diseases typically have marks or lesions on the leaves, stems, flowers, or fruits. The technology is designed to be deployed in the cloud for real-time disease detection and uses advanced, lightweight deep learning models and large image sets collected directly from agricultural fields covering all scenarios to achieve accurate disease detection results.  In addition, the technology is designed to provide detection results in multiple modalities based on users’ needs including disease score and images with segmentation for visualization and measurements of the size or count of diseased areas. The application may be used to collect and record the appropriate crop images to the cloud.

Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may serve as a model and impetus for similar institutions of higher education to develop degree programs. The connection of faculty to the development of novel opportunities for programs of study that ensure successful transfer to local employment, particularly tribal employment, or to baccalaureate studies at nearby universities will demonstrate the essentiality of engaging full-time, credentialed STEM faculty devoted to a specific strand of study and preparation. Moreover, for those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is crucially important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>This project provides an accredited STEM associate of science (AS) degree in the natural sciences at White Earth Tribal and Community College (WETCC) for students who may then transfer to a local university for upper division studies to pursue a baccalaureate degree or be prepared for employment at local, particularly tribal, service organizations. The AS project recognizes and furthers students’ ability to pursue degrees in the natural sciences to include chemistry and physics, in addition to biology—a degree that can have a significant benefit to the career and life options for TCU students. The increase in specialized STEM faculty, specifically chemistry and physics, ensures that the curricular offerings have relevance more broadly to related programs of study. Strengthening the natural sciences provides a grounding and assists student success and matriculation into other programs of study, including health sciences, that are sometimes marginalized by funding agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineering plants to fix nitrogen could improve the sustainability of the bioeconomy. However, we lack the knowledge to predict the behavior and specificity of electron carriers such as ferredoxin, which are needed to power nitrogenase. There is a critical need to test eukaryotic electron transfer components for their ability to interact with nitrogenase and measure how changes in the cellular redox environment sustain electron flow. The overall objective of the research proposed here is to use a bacterial chassis to rapidly define how eukaryotic electron transfer components can participate in electron delivery to nitrogenase and invent a powerful platform for evolution of synthetic electron flow pathways. The research aims synergize with educational goals by incorporating a semester-long project that focuses on bioengineering nitrogen fixation into existing courses using a novel culturally responsive pedagogical framework.<br/><br/>The central hypothesis for the project is that electron transfer to nitrogenase is one of the primary constraints preventing introduction of this enzyme into eukaryotic systems, but it is possible to select for variants in eukaryotic electron transfer components to overcome this bottleneck. To test this hypothesis, the investigator proposes to develop a new tool to analyze electron flow to nitrogenase. This tool will use a bacterial chassis to test eukaryotic electron transfer components at physiological levels and evolve these electron transfer components for enhanced electron flow to nitrogenase. Such a contribution would be significant because it would enable more accurate predictions regarding nitrogenase functionality within plant organelles and would establish a robust platform for optimizing electron transfer to nitrogenase. This would not only make the goal of engineering plants to fix nitrogen more attainable, but it would also further our understanding of the determinants of electron flow and how electron transfer pathways can be optimized for biotechnological purposes.

The last decade witnessed a tremendous progress in the development and manufacturing of prototypical quantum computers. Though still noisy and subject to errors and decoherence, they are already capable of performing non-trivial tasks.  This brought a quest for meaningful computational problems, which may be tackled with the help of available quantum architecture. One such problem is optimization, that is finding an outcome (i.e. a sequence of bits), which optimizes a certain intricate set of criteria (known as a cost function). From the physics perspective, this is a problem of finding low energy states (i.e. cooling) of a disordered media (aka glass). The project will implement such glassy landscapes with available qubit platforms and develop cooling protocols utilizing the quantum dynamics of their constituent elements. It was realized that the ideal quantumness greatly facilitates cooling. The project will investigate the effectiveness of real-life noisy-dissipative qubit arrays to accomplish these tasks. It will develop specific algorithms, implement them on commercially available devices (utilizing the NSF Cloud Bank funding mechanism) and compare their performance with theoretical expectations.  <br/><br/>The award also facilitates the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the US STEM workforce through development of quantum computation curriculum, preparing review articles, organization of workshops, and summer schools. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research, education, and outreach activities with a goal to develop a theory and protocols for specific quantum algorithms, which may be implemented on commercial platforms, available through the NSF Cloud Bank. On the theory part, the qubit arrays represent examples of open dissipative quantum systems, which are driven by time-dependent local fields and couplings.  Such a driven-dissipative environment can be modeled by the Lindbladian. The project will extend theoretical tools of non-equilibrium quantum field theory, to incorporate Lindbladian dynamics. One of the goals of this construction is to elucidate the existence and properties of the many-body localization transition in the Hilbert space of the array. Understanding of such transitions is crucial to developing protocols for the effective quantum cooling (i.e. approximate quantum optimization). Specifically, cooling of the glassy many-body localized phase may be achieved through periodic quantum melting through the first order transition and refreezing through the second order transition. The project will develop a theory of such dissipative cooling cycles and implement them on the D-Wave 5000-qubit platform.  It will also develop tools for analyzing the resulting “experimental” data sets. <br/><br/>The award also facilitates the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the US STEM workforce through development of quantum computation curriculum, preparing review articles, organization of workshops, and summer schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will further show how these networks affect justice, court narratives, and public knowledge about massive violations of human rights. NGO-prosecutorial networks affect trials and knowledge about violations in two ways. They color charges and court proceedings by channeling evidence, witnesses, and private prosecutors—some constituted out of refugee populations—into trials. In addition, NGOs contribute to the spread of contextualized court narratives through trial observation and the publication of blogs and reports on websites. The nature of these causal processes will be explored. American interest in these experiences is substantial, especially considering the “Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act” that recently updated federal law to enable prosecution of alleged war criminals in the United States—regardless of the place of perpetration and the nationality of the perpetrator or the victim. During this project, graduate students will be trained, and knowledge gained will be incorporated into college and graduate instruction. Insights will be communicated through a public-facing paper, workshops with practitioners, and a symposium.<br/><br/>The project builds on scholarship that examines how criminal trials shape knowledge about and collective memory of mass atrocity crimes. This body of research shows that trials often affect public perceptions and collective memories of such crimes, even while constrained by the institutional logic of criminal law with its focus on individuals, disinterest in structural contexts and the longue durée, limiting evidentiary rules, and guilty-not guilty binaries. The proposed research looks beyond the confines of judicial institutions to examine their network ties with civil society in the form of NGOs, domestically and across national boundaries: a transnational NGO-prosecutorial complex. The project will enhance knowledge at the intersection of the sociology of law, knowledge, collective memory, and inter-organizational networks. The research includes in-depth interviews with prosecutors, investigators, and NGO representatives, in several countries engaging in UJ proceedings. Interviews explore organizational goals, the structure of exchange networks between organizations and the content of exchanges. An analysis of court documents will trace how NGO agendas, input, and networks are reflected in trial narratives.

However, existing statistical methods either cannot be applied, fail to capture the complex relationships between the response variables, or lead to models that are difficult to interpret and thus, yield little scientific insight. The PIs address this deficiency by developing multiple new statistical methods. For each new method, the PIs will provide theoretical justifications and fast computational algorithms. Along with graduate and undergraduate students, the PIs will also create publicly available software that will enable applications across both academia and industry.<br/><br/>This project aims to address a fundamental problem in multivariate categorical data analysis: how to parsimoniously model the joint probability mass function of many categorical random variables given a common set of high-dimensional predictors. The PIs will tackle this problem by using emerging technologies on tensor decompositions, dimension reduction, and both convex and non-convex optimization. The project focuses on three research directions: (1) a latent variable approach for the low-rank decomposition of a conditional probability tensor; (2) a new overlapping convex penalty for intrinsic dimension reduction in a multivariate generalized linear regression framework; and (3) a direct non-convex optimization-based approach for low-rank tensor regression utilizing explicit rank constraints on the Tucker tensor decomposition.

To approach a solution for this grand challenge, this project aims to significantly advance the holistic understanding and modeling of the interconnected C, N, P, and water cycles in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. This goal will be pursued by developing an AI-based framework of integrated nutrient, streamflow, and parcel simulation for resilient agroecosystems (INSPIRE) that can easily ingest multi-source observations and provide an accurate and speedy quantification from the field to basin scale. The outcomes from this project are expected to provide valuable insights for policymakers and farming communities, particularly in optimizing management practices for improved carbon sequestration, soil health, and water quality in the America's heartland.

First, a Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML)-based INSPIRE-Field model will be developed to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of field-level C, N, P, and hydrological interactions. Second, INSPIRE-Field will be coupled with Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based hydrologic surrogate models that first aggregate field water and nutrient fluxes within small watersheds (i.e., INSPIRE-Watershed), and then routing watershed outputs throughout the Upper Mississippi River Basin (i.e., INSPIRE-Basin). To reduce the uncertainty of INSPIRE, a novel representation learning method to efficiently assimilate remote and in-situ sensing data via low-dimensional embeddings will be explored. Third, a user-friendly web interface will be developed that allows stakeholders to preview outcomes of different climate- smart management practices and identify field-specific preferred management strategies based on multiobjective optimizations for C, N, P, and hydrological goals.

The defining feature of nematic phases is orientational order in that the individual molecules are generally aligned along the same direction, yet their location is disordered. As a consequence, these materials flow like a normal fluid, yet they display solid like features when forces affect their orientational order. Such a hybrid nature is key to recent applications in flow control, material shape design and engineering, even actuation and soft robotics induced by light. More widely, a number of biological tissues exhibit the same properties in that oriented individual cells respond as a nematic phase, and such a response is involved in biological function. Theories to be developed in this project will describe the properties and response of those nematic materials that are comprised of complex molecular units, such a long organic molecules, stacks of individual disks in solution, or aggregates of living cells. The theory will pay special attention to defects in nematic phases. These are small regions in which the orientational order is broken, and that are known to determine the characteristic properties of the material. Such an observation lies at the center of recent efforts in the so-called defect engineering field, which seeks not to eliminate defects, but rather to produce them and to control their location and motion in order to produce material properties that would be unachievable in ideal materials without defects. A theoretical understanding of defects, their interactions, and their motion is central to enable further advances in defect engineering and the many applications that are currently being explored involving nematic phases.<br/><br/>On the educational side, the project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students, the latter through Summer internships and Honors Thesis projects. In addition, the PI has created and is teaching a new senior undergraduate course PHYS 4041, “Computational Methods in the Physical Sciences'' which is taken by students in Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering.

As the research proposed overlaps with Physics, Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Computational Science, there are many opportunities to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research, including Honors projects.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>This project addresses morphology, topological defects, and nonequilibrium transport in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals, both theoretically and through large scale computation. This material is studied in its nematic phase which displays long range orientational order with characteristic elastic response and defected textures. The research is motivated by recent developments in experimental diagnostics that give, for the first time, access to quantitative detail in the sub-micron range near topological singularities of the nematic director field, as well as related determinations of the material's elastic constants and rheology. These developments open the door to quantitative theories of liquid crystals with complex molecular architectures, extension to many realistic natural systems of the well-known small molecule and isotropic limits. This is necessary as nematic response is under active scrutiny in applications of active and biological matter that display nematic order.<br/><br/>A self-consistent field theory is proposed to determine free energies of elastically anisotropic nematics. Phenomenological gradient expansions as in, for example, the Landau-de Gennes theory, lead to unbounded energies to the lowest order necessary to incorporate anisotropy. The functional space to the next order that is necessary to restore boundedness is too large to make the theory viable or useful. A computational implementation of a singular potential method has been introduced as an alternative. It has been validated with experimental determinations of singularity profiles in lyotropic chromonics, as well as with equilibrium morphologies of two phase tactoids. This method will be extended into a field theory that can accommodate two distinct features of chromonics: the microscopic units are charged aggregates, and of length that can change depending on distortion. Novel behavior is expected because the complexity of the interactions in lyotropics manifests itself in very small twist elastic constants, leading to novel modes of disclination interactions in three dimensions, to the appearance of configurations with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and even to propagating localized structures. The analysis will be fully three-dimensional and framed within a newly introduced topological invariant for uniaxial phases and an exact kinematic law for the motion of disclinations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The efficiency of this technology is vital in enabling energy sustainability and reducing humanity's carbon footprint. Conventional electric motors rely on bearings to support their shafts. Unfortunately, these bearings have critical lifetime, reliability, and efficiency shortcomings that limit the electrification of transportation systems, the utilization of renewable generation technologies, and the efficiency of fluid handling infrastructure. This project will investigate a new type of motor that does not use bearings. The new bearingless motors will utilize electric current to create controllable magnetic forces that function as set of bearings. The new motors will look and behave in fundamentally different ways that will enable new, extremely efficient, and ultra-reliable systems. This project targets a 9% reduction in US electric energy consumption by enabling new concepts in compressor systems, electrified transportation, renewable energy generation, and energy storage. To translate these research outcomes into the real world, the project incorporates engagement of both the technical community and general public.  Beyond the research outcomes, the team's outreach activities will facilitate development of the diverse STEM workforce needed to maintain US leadership in electromechanical power conversion. The team will develop interactive public exhibits of motor and levitation technology and host STEM-enriched experiences aimed at increasing interest and participation in STEM opportunities for middle and high school females and youth from rural, economically disadvantaged regions.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The objective of this research is to overcome fundamental challenges of both conventional motor bearings and magnetic bearings. While today's electric motors utilize and control only one degree of freedom (rotation) this project will develop a new generation of electric motors that are precisely actuated in all six degrees of freedom. These new motors will utilize magnetic field forces that are already present within the motor to create a completely bearingless motor that levitates its own shaft. Modelling, control, and design techniques will be developed to unify the science of electric motors and magnetic levitation. The project will use analytic and numeric modeling approaches to create a framework that models the normal and tangential magnetic stresses on the rotor's surface. This framework will be used to determine the required stator currents needed to produce exact force and torque vectors on the motor's shaft. The project will research optimal design of these new motors and test prototypes to validate this new science. The team will develop the science of bearingless motors for both high speed motor systems (industrial compressors and power grid flywheel energy storage) and low speed motor systems (large diameter, rim-driven motors for flight electrification). The outcomes of the research will be disseminated through the standard channels of academic research (presentations and papers) as well as through the construction of a portable bearingless motor prototype that will be exhibited in public demonstrations, conferences, and visits to research institutes. The team will also develop open source, interactive laboratory electronics kits to demonstrate the principles of magnetic levitation and electromechanical power conversion that will be promoted to allow youth to develop county fair exhibits, lifelong learners to explore electromechanical principles, and teachers to adapt the material for their curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For millions of the world’s seasonally-frozen lakes, this warming means shorter and thinner ice cover and changing patterns of snow accumulation on the ice. Because ice and snow affect many fundamental physical, chemical, and biological properties of lakes, changes in winter conditions can disrupt lake ecosystems and the services they provide to humanity. Until recently, lake scientists paid relatively little attention to winter, meaning we know very little about how lakes work when covered by ice and snow and how winter conditions affect the rest of the year. This leaves scientists ill-prepared to predict how changing winters will impact lakes or to mitigate negative impacts. This study addresses this “winter knowledge gap” and develops a predictive understanding of how winter conditions affect the ecological populations, communities, and food webs of diverse types of lakes. Along with intensive studies of lakes by the core project team, the investigators are also recruiting researchers from dozens of institutions to expand sampling to many additional lakes. This ‘Team Science’ approach will train many aquatic scientists in specialized winter sampling methods, empowering other scientists to include studies of winter conditions in their research programs. It will develop a network of winter-hardy aquatic researchers with the goal of advancing understanding of year-round ecosystem function in the face of climate change. The project provides education and training opportunities for multiple graduate and undergraduate students and a postbaccalaureate researcher.<br/><br/>This study combines two approaches: 1) detailed seasonal studies of ecological processes in 12 lakes by the project’s investigators; and 2) research across at least 60 other lakes by a network of collaborators. In the first part of the effort, the investigators are focusing on 12 lakes with contrasting water quality characteristics and winter severity. The lakes are being instrumented with continuously-recording temperature, light, and oxygen sensors. The investigators are also studying water, bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton throughout the year to determine how plankton populations and communities evolve through seasons in different lake types. Using stable isotopes and fatty acid analysis, the investigators are assessing the way food web structure changes across seasons and the production and cycling of organic matter. For the second part of the study, the investigators are recruiting a network of researchers to collect samples from at least another 60 lakes. These collaborators are being trained in winter research methods and are provided with sampling kits and instructions for sample collection. Their samples are being analyzed with samples from the core set of 12 lakes, ensuring compatibility of results. Collaboration between the co-PIs and their network is allowing for broad participation in interpretation of data and testing of hypotheses about the way winter severity interacts with water quality to affect lake ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF’s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet there is not a general framework that directly connects the social and biophysical environment to host contact rates. The overall objectives of this research are to provide protected time and support for a mid-career researcher to update her quantitative tools under the mentorship of two early-career partners with said expertise, and to test how the environment links to contact rate using high-resolution movement data and modern movement-contact analyses. Once disease-producing host contacts are tied to environmental features, animal movement data can be used to predict the location of contacts and consequent pathogen transmission in novel environments. Given current global concern over the emergence of new diseases and host reservoirs, such as sustained transmission of SARS-COV-2 in deer, it is vital to understand, predict, and manage disease spread in wildlife, livestock, and human systems.<br/><br/>The specific scientific aims of this study are to: (1) learn to use a newly developed movement-contact model (i.e., MoveSTIR); (2) extend the theory of MoveSTIR to understand how environmental context shapes contact hotspot dynamics; and (3) apply the expanded MoveSTIR to empirical movement and disease data from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to identify social and biophysical contexts of transmission. This proposal will develop an approach that integrates aspects of an animal’s social and biophysical environment with high-resolution movement data to predict contact hotspots relevant for disease transmission, in novel landscapes. This research leverages ongoing data collection from a new movement and disease study of 40 GPS-collared deer and integrates empirical data into the novel workflow. This project will also broaden participation in research by providing professional development opportunities and training for a female mid-career researcher; lead to a NIMBioS workshop for other scientists interested in the interface between animal movement and disease transmission including a user-friendly R package for the MoveSTIR model; and strengthen ties between researchers, the public, and wildlife managers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meaningful progress on these complex scientific and societal issues will require a diversity of viewpoints and voices. However, the geosciences are one of the least diverse STEM fields. The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) has developed a program titled Connecting Opportunities for Research Experiences in the Geosciences (CORE) to develop holistic strategies to create more inclusive pathways in the geosciences. This project brings together two highly successful groups within SMM: the St. Croix Watershed Research Station (SCWRS), a field research station specializing in primary research in the geosciences, and the Kitty Andersen Youth Science Center (KAYSC), a group that provides out-of-school programming for hundreds of underserved youth each year with the goals of building leadership and science communication skills, career readiness and workforce development, and fostering appreciation of and confidence in working with STEM. Bringing together these two areas of expertise, along with a community network support of geoscience faculty and professionals, will create an effective, long-lasting, and supportive pathway to geoscience careers.   <br/><br/>CORE will be built around the KAYSC’s STEM Justice framework, an ecosystem learning model for engaging youth in STEM learning through a justice-focused lens centered around solving real-world community issues. Youth will engage with an ongoing SCWRS research project in paleolimnology focusing on the effects of road salt on lakes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro region. Additionally, CORE will build a Community Network of Support of geoscience faculty from regional colleges and universities, as well as geoscience professionals from community-based organizations; this will build a professional support network as program youth take the next steps in geoscience programs or careers. Through the application of the STEM Justice model, CORE will develop strategies to inclusively introduce youth to geoscience research and networks, increasing the likelihood that they pursue college or career pathways in the geosciences. The three project goals are: 1) Train adult mentors/geoscience professionals in STEM Justice practices; 2) Engage young people in a defined and meaningful research project in paleolimnology; and 3) Provide young people with access to geoscience undergraduate programs and careers. By training geoscience professionals in more inclusive practices, engaging youth in relevant geosciences research, and creating systems of support between these groups, we will develop and share a sustainable, inclusive pathway for youth in the geosciences that will live beyond this project and can serve as a model for other institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Minnesota is currently last in the nation for K-12 CS education with only 21% of high schools offering a foundational CS course according to the 2022 State of Computer Science Education report. CS pathways will include early experiences in elementary and middle school that will help students establish foundational CS knowledge and skills as well as spark the interest of students historically marginalized in computing, followed by the opportunity for interested students to take high school CS electives. Districts participating in the project serve approximately 15,000 students and 1,000 classroom teachers in Minnesota. Given the geographic location, a largely rural area which is the homeland of seven tribes of Anishinaabeg, the most populous Indigenous group in North America, two specific outcomes are to develop Ojibwe language for CS concepts and practices so that CS lessons can be taught in Ojibwe and develop CS lessons that include Ojibwe language and culture.<br/><br/>This is a large, Pathways strand research-practitioner partnership between the National Center for CS Education at the College of Saint Scholastica, Hermantown Community School, Fond du Lac Ojibwe School, St. Louis County Public schools and Duluth Public schools. To support participating school districts in addressing the CS pathways, the proposed project will: 1) Create a professional learning network (PLN) for 8 school districts in rural or tribal communities; 2) Collaborate with rural and tribal educators to develop inclusive K-8 CS-integrated curricular materials aligned to Minnesota Department of Education standards; 3) Expand connections between Ojibwe language and culture and CS and develop supporting resources; and 4) Support districts in creating sustainable K12 CS pathways. This project will answer the following research questions: 1) How have other Minnesota districts built and implemented a K12 CS Pathway?; 2) For project districts, what are the conditions for addressing equity in CS for Native American students and students with a special education designation?; and 3) After project districts have built and implemented a K12 CS Pathway, what are the conditions for sustainability? The project will develop CS models that other Minnesota districts could use for developing K-12 CS pathways.

Over its 6-year duration, the ""Concordia Leads: Instructing and Mentoring in Biotechnology"" (CLIMB) project will provide scholarships to 36 undergraduate students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Neuroscience, and/or Physics. First-year students may receive up to five years of scholarship support. The project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields by linking scholarships with effective supporting activities, including academic support services, mentoring, undergraduate research experiences, paid internships, and participation in discipline-specific conferences. Through partnerships with local biotechnology companies, this project will prepare students for careers in biotechnology – an industry identified as an area of national importance and one that is experiencing tremendous growth in the region around the college and across the country. Because Concordia College is an increasingly diverse institution that recruits from a region with a high population of underrepresented students, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM fields and build the next generation of workers in the biotechnology industry.<br/><br/>The principal goal of the CLIMB project is to recruit, retain, and prepare academically talented, low-income students interested in pursuing careers in biotechnology. Four specific objectives will guide the work of the project team. First is to build a diverse applicant pool with recruiting strategies targeted toward students from populations underrepresented in their pursuit of STEM careers and biotechnology in particular. Second is to provide both academic and social support systems focused on retaining scholars and allowing them to flourish. Third is to connect scholars with a network of mentors who will provide personal, academic, social, and vocational support. Fourth, and finally, is to work with local industry partners to offer vocational guidance, knowledge, and experiences that will prepare scholars for successful careers in biotechnology. Three cohorts of 12 CLIMB scholars will be selected. Once at Concordia, a number of support systems will be provided for the scholars. Cohorts will first form an Orientation Club that will become a first-year seminar course with a focus on strategies for successful learning in STEM. CLIMB scholars will have regular meetings with academic counselors and access to prioritized academic support services. A coordinated network of mentors, including faculty, staff, peers, and STEM professionals will support the scholars throughout their academic journey. In partnership with local biotechnology companies, scholars will be offered vocational opportunities including career awareness presentations, industry tours, teaching seminars, research experiences, and paid internships. Program evaluation will be performed by an external evaluator, and formative guidance will be regularly provided by an industry advisory panel. The effectiveness of the strategies developed and tested for recruiting underrepresented populations, supporting them both academically and socially, educating and mentoring them for careers in biotechnology, and preparing them for success will be disseminated to inform the broader STEM education community, thereby widening the impact of the CLIMB program beyond Concordia’s campus. This project is funded by NSF’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

The EPIIC award is to establish an innovation ecosystem in a cohort-based model specifically designed for primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). The cohort comprises a diverse range of institutions with varying demographics, sizes, missions, and locations. The primary goals of this project are twofold: (1) to develop innovation capacity within the cohort institutions and (2) to collectively establish best practices and foster a community of innovation for PUIs. This regional ecosystem encompasses several rural institutions, many of which cater to low-income and first-generation students, while others have a significant representation of historically underrepresented students in STEM fields. The cohort is deeply committed to implementing institutional changes that expand access to career opportunities requiring advanced skills in their respective regions. The overarching aim is to cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship among the cohort members, empowering each institution to play an expanded role within the regional economy. <br/><br/>The award's purpose is to establish a Symbiotic Collaboration for Regional Ecosystem (SCORE) cohort, which introduces an innovative approach to enhancing STEM innovation capacity. This approach stems from the cohort's undergraduate-focused mission and its strong emphasis on students and the communities they serve. The proposed project envisions a community-based approach, fostering the development of best practices in various aspects of innovation and partnerships, including workforce development, experiential learning, research and innovation, industry partnerships, investors, entrepreneurship, and regulatory issues. Operating as a community of practice, the cohort of primarily undergraduate institutions will collaborate, learn, and grow together while upholding the values of inclusive excellence as a central aspect of the project. The greatest collective impact the cohort will have will come from the increased capacity to serve the regions’ economic and community needs and to expand institutional capacity to provide access for students into an advanced, quickly evolving STEM workforce. A broader impact of this cohort-based learning community for innovation will result in infrastructure for innovation capacity, continued collaborations, enhancing innovation capacity for the STEM workforce, and developing models and best practices for PUIs nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can discourage people from learning about this important topic and makes it difficult for instructors to keep current in the subject. The lesson plans that will be developed in this project will make immunology concepts easier to understand and help teachers feel comfortable teaching immunology across all levels of courses. This work by ImmunoReach will help improve the quality of biology education and support public understanding of important societal issues such as combatting infectious disease, vaccination, and impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>ImmunoReach is an interdisciplinary Community of Practice (CoP) that aims to foster immune literacy and increase access to immunology education beyond traditional immunology-specific classrooms. This CoP will identify a common language between disciplines to discuss and share curricular challenges and solutions with the broader community. To accomplish this, we will look towards the key concepts and competencies described in The Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action report, and Benchmarks for Science Literacy (AAAS, 2011 and 1993, respectively). The ImmunoReach network will bring together educators who are committed to the goals of fostering immune literacy, through the use of evidence-based pedagogical practices. The network will develop teaching resources that integrate immunology-related interdisciplinary learning outcomes, for example, those intersecting with microbiology, genetics, ecology, evolution, physiology and chemistry. Less experienced educators of immunology, representing diverse institutional and disciplinary expertise, will be paired with experienced immunology educators for developing, implementing, and assessing these interdisciplinary teaching resources, based on a backward design approach and active learning strategies. The products generated at the end of this project will be shared with the network participants and the broader community through ImmunoReach’s QUBES hub site, virtual symposiums, conference presentations, journal publications, and other outreach activities. The network will empower educators to positively impact diverse student populations with the ultimate aim to foster immune literacy.

There are several broader impacts of this project. The first is the scientific training of CSBSJU undergraduates and the enhancement of cutting-edge biomolecular characterization in the undergraduate teaching laboratories, which will reach 226 undergraduates per year. CD spectroscopy is an excellent addition to the interdisciplinary foundational laboratory curriculum at CSBSJU that is instrument focused. In addition, CD spectroscopy provides depth to upper-division research-based laboratory experiences. This project will allow all chemistry and biochemistry majors to gain hands on experience with CD spectroscopy which will aid in their preparation for strong performance in graduate school and the scientific work force. The CD spectrometer will not only strengthen the research infrastructure of CSBSJU, but it will also be made available to those who are part of the Midwest regional hub of the MDH CUREs Community (Malate Dehydrogenase Course Undergraduate Research Experience, NSF #2119918), which the PI of this grant leads. This will offer expanded opportunities for students from under resourced institutions as that is the focus of the MDH CUREs Community.

Although the semiconductor industry has dedicated several decades to making chips smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient, the environmental impact has often been neglected. While technology scaling and electronic design automation (EDA) have facilitated designing energy-efficient very large-scale integrated (VLSI) systems that lower operational CFP, the overall environmental footprint has continued to grow, primarily due to carbon emissions from chip design and manufacturing processes. To ensure the sustainable use of modern computing, it is crucial to develop design techniques that not only meet power, performance, and area (PPA) targets but also consider the CFP. With today's trillion-transistor VLSI systems being designed by heterogeneously integrating a set of chiplets, each corresponding to a single die, onto a substrate to reduce costs, and new design methodologies to support these technologies being rolled out, now is an ideal time to help shape these methodologies to be more sustainable. The novelty of this project lies in paving a path toward sustainable design and manufacturing of VLSI systems through heterogeneous integration (HI). It defines metrics related to CFP and develops simulators and optimizers that integrate with design methodologies to measure and reduce the overall CFP. <br/><br/>Inspired by the principles of environmental sustainability—reduce, reuse, and recycle—this project aims to decrease the CFP associated with modern heterogeneous VLSI systems. HI systems offer great potential for sustainable computing by ""reducing"" carbon emissions through minimized computation required for designing each component from scratch and by ""reusing"" pre-designed chiplet intellectual property (IP) blocks through hierarchical approaches. Reusing chiplets across multiple designs, implemented in different technology nodes, within the current generation of integrated circuits (ICs) and even in future generations can significantly alleviate the manufacturing CFP. This project develops EDA approaches that (a) measure the carbon impact of heterogeneous VLSI system by building simulators that analyze its CFP across the design, manufacturing, and operational levels of a supply chain; (b) design methods for building high-performance HI systems, a new capability to be developed (since viable HI design flows do not exist today), tuned for efficient computation to reduce design-time carbon; (c) extend methodologies in the design task to incorporate the simulators from the measure task, to optimize the carbon footprint of a design, subject to PPA specifications on the HI design. This project outlines environmentally conscious computing practices by emphasizing the integration of CFP-related metrics into HI design methodologies and brings the community's attention to this critical issue in the semiconductor industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

FREE is unique from other B1 imaging approaches because of its high immunity to magnetic imperfections. FREE, unlike other approaches, can appropriately image in highly inhomogeneous (and inexpensive) magnets. A scanner built around FREE would take advantage of the cost savings that come with removing B0 gradient coils and from reducing the homogeneity of a magnet.

This iron is supplied by dust that is carried from land out across the ocean by strong winds, or by volcanic activity deep within the ocean.  However, large areas of the ocean are very remote from both land and deep-sea volcanic activity, and the amount of iron that reaches these areas is quite small.  In these regions microscopic life is often limited by the very low concentrations of iron that characterize this environment.  To use iron, microbes must first extract it from seawater.  To do this, some microbes have the ability to manufacture unique organic compounds called siderophores that are specifically designed to capture iron from seawater and transport it into the cell.  The presence of siderophores in seawater acts as a signal to know where in the ocean iron may be limiting microbial productivity.<br/><br/>US GEOTRACES program is a cooperative, multi-investigator effort to make high quality, high-resolution measurements of metal concentrations across representative sections of major ocean basins.

Access to high-quality public-use data is critical for many research disciplines. However, analyses of fine-scale geographic regions with small population sizes (e.g., census tracts) often yield statistically unreliable inference.  Small areas also may contain few study participants, thus increasing the risk of disclosure of sensitive information about a participant, such as an individual's disease or employment status.  This project will create a unifying framework between the formal privacy literature and the spatial statistics literature that gives equal weight to privacy considerations and the utility of the resulting data. The results of this research will be of value both to academic researchers and staff at the Federal statistical agencies. The investigator will collaborate with researchers at the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics. Workshops and short courses will be developed by the investigator on spatial statistics and data privacy for staff at the Federal statistical agencies. The project also will create undergraduate research opportunities in Bayesian inference and statistical computing and provide educational opportunities related to spatial statistics and data privacy.<br/><br/>This project will develop Bayesian statistical methods for generating spatially referenced synthetic data that achieve or exceed the privacy protections currently implemented by U.S. Federal statistical agencies.  Small area estimation methods from the spatial statistics literature provide a framework to leverage complex dependencies in the data to improve the precision of an estimate.  Emerging methods from the data privacy literature may be used to mask or otherwise conceal information from these areas to protect the privacy guarantees made to the data subjects in exchange for their participation.  Taken together, these two approaches present an analytic tension between providing accurate and reliable local estimates and the need to obscure detailed linkage between small area estimates and the data subjects residing therein.

Here, researchers integrate field data with modeling and laboratory experiments with representative cultures to identify microbes’ functional roles in marine organic matter degradation and to determine their response to changing environmental conditions.  This project will open new windows into the diversity of microbial metabolisms and how these dynamics will shift with global change driven increases in temperature and other environmental factors.

This project will develop a model microbial consortium that has the potential to transform perception of carbon cycling in coastal systems by integrating functional, organismal-interaction and environment-dependent responses into a modeling framework. Empirical Dynamic Modeling will identify drivers of the observed dynamics, differentiate causation from correlation, infer effects of possibly unobserved variables (e.g. predation), and quantify interactions between organisms. This data will further be used to develop a culturable model consortium whose members metabolize distinct components of phytoplankton-derived organic matter. To test both model predictions and how well the consortium represents complex microbiomes, both the model consortium and a “wild” coastal seawater microbiome will be assayed for changes in function (phytoplankton DOM degradation) as temperatures increase (+4 °C). These experiments will compare outcomes for individual isolates, the consortium, and a wild coastal microbiome in composition/abundance, gene expression and degradation of specific compounds. Finally, experimental results will be used to parameterize and refine an Ensemble Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics model that can predict the fate and transformation of carbon in marine systems under varying climate scenarios. While this research leverages existing expertise in marine microbiomes, this model consortium approach can be applied to diverse systems to answer questions about environmental filtering, organismal interactions and functional diversity critical to predicting ecosystem-level responses to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Acknowledging the significant role that computation plays in student knowledge and skills, academic programs of study, and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the project initiates  a wide-ranging effort to integrate computation into all levels of the undergraduate physics program. Recognizing the importance of broad-based efforts in higher education to foster the success of students with diverse talents and experiences, the project integrates this perspective in its approach to establish, integrate, and sustain computation in physics. Guided by national reports, this department-level multi-year structured change effort - led by a departmental Computation Implementation Task Force - has strategically selected two mid-level courses for initial implementation.<br/> <br/>The project aims to (1) integrate computation as a standard tool to solve physics problems into the undergraduate physics curriculum and (2) establish a departmental process for sustaining changes to the curriculum and teaching practices. In alignment with the department-wide effort, the project is mapped to Kotter’s Eight Stage Model of Institutional Change with a specific focus on communicating the change vision, empowering broad-based action, and generating short-term successes. Importantly, this effort has intentionally integrated evidence to guide the change process. Project inputs are aligned with proposed activities, deliverables, expected outcomes, vision of change, and targeted/broad dissemination activities. Data collected relating to students’ performance and experiences include information from student records, course assessments, surveys, and semi-structured interviews with a subset of students. These are compared to historical and pre-post data. Data collected from faculty through quasi-ethnographic interviews will probe their experience and perceptions of the curricula modifications and the change process. The team will conduct thematic analyses of qualitative data and descriptive comparative analyses of quantitative data and the findings will be disseminated to internal audiences (to guide department change efforts) and external audiences (to contribute to knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of establishing computation as a problem-solving tool into the physics curriculum).

The analysis of these ice cores will improve our understanding of the history of cosmic rays originating from outside of our solar system. The historical rate at which cosmic rays reach the solar system is important to understand for studies of past solar activity and past glacier extent. Solar activity is an important driver of Earth’s climate, and glacier extent is an important part of the Earth’s climate system. This project will also improve our understanding of the cycle of atmospheric methane. Methane has both natural and human-caused sources and is an important greenhouse gas and a key player in global atmospheric chemistry. <br/><br/>Records of atmospherically produced cosmogenic nuclides have been used to reconstruct past solar activity and solar irradiance. Cosmogenic nuclides produced in surface rock are widely used in studies of past ice dynamics and extent. All these studies generally assume that the galactic cosmic ray flux at Earth is constant in time, but this is uncertain by 30% or more. This project will use measurements of in situ cosmogenic carbon-14 of carbon monoxide (14CO) in new ice cores from Dome C, Antarctica to test the assumption of constant galactic cosmic ray flux. Almost all 14CO in ice from Dome C is from high-energy, deep-penetrating muons, and the 14CO production rate is only sensitive to the galactic cosmic ray flux. This project will also look at carbon-14 of methane (14CH4), which can be used to unambiguously distinguish contemporaneous sources of methane (e.g., wetlands, animals, biomass burning) from ancient carbon sources (geologic methane seeps, methane hydrates, permafrost). The natural geologic source in particular is one of the most uncertain terms in the global methane budget. The proposed work would help to improve estimates of the natural geologic source magnitude via new measurements of atmospheric 14CH4 over the last ≈7000 years.

Safety is of the utmost importance in transportation, as mistakes can be expensive, dangerous, or fatal. News stories about robotaxis creating havoc on the streets highlight the challenges posed by complex real-world traffic environments. Clearly, AVs with fully autonomous driving still have a long way to go, in spite of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). AV tele-operations are suggested as an alternative approach, wherein a human operator remotely controls an AV, perhaps only partially as the need arises. This notion is inspired by the potential offered by emerging fifth-generation (5G) networks. However, as of now, 5G for AV tele-operations remains more aspirational, as many challenges remain. The goal of this project is to tackle the challenges in supporting (partial) AV tele-operations over 5G and next-generation (NextG) networks. This project helps facilitate safe and incremental adoption of (tele-operated) AVs to address societal challenges, while accelerating AV technology towards full autonomy. In particular, it provides a unique opportunity for testing AV tele-operations in Midwest winter and other scenarios. The project also serves as a forum for academia-government-industry collaboration and technology translation, and as a nexus point for broadening participation in research, education, and community outreach.<br/><br/><br/>This interdisciplinary and transformative research agenda develops integrated networking, systems and AI support for AV tele-operations. Key innovations include: 1) a semantics-oriented and fine-grained networking framework that exploits diversity to provide high bandwidth and low latency; 2) an agile, secure-by-design edge systems architecture that is optimized for AI workloads; 3) a novel application-driven, cross-layer and whole-system approach that enables cooperation across end devices, networks, edge systems and human operators; 4) an “AI-native” paradigm that systematically integrates AI/ML algorithms across layers and system components, with built-in mechanisms to mitigate the risks of inaccurate or false AI predictions; and finally, 5) a human-centered approach that combines faster-than-real-time AI simulations and integrated machine & human intelligence to seamlessly support human-in/on-the-loop. These innovations are incorporated into a prototype AV tele-operation platform called NextMOVE that provides resilient, safety-critical support for (partially) tele-operated AVs.

Other countries mine and process most of the world’s REE supply. US mines can contribute to 15% of the world’s annual supply of rare-earth elements. However, US mines produce mixtures of these elements, which cannot be used in applications until they are separated from one another. This program will develop sustainable strategies for separating and recovering rare-earth elements and platinum group metals from waste streams. This project will utilize electrically-driven separations to separate these valuable elements. This approach is modular, reversible, minimize waste, and can be driven by renewable sources. Electrode materials that bind these elements will be developed from conductive polymers and carbon nanotubes. Beyond contributing to the critical materials economy, the knowledge gained can be applied to other challenging separations, like removing heavy metals and toxic contaminants from water. This project will also help educate and cultivate a diverse future workforce with key competencies in data science, computation, and experiments. New educational content will be released, students will be trained on advanced materials topics, and K-12 outreach programs will be implemented. <br/><br/>Technical Description: Electrochemical charge-transfer materials have been proposed as new-generation technologies for separation processes, including water desalination, critical element recovery, and remediation of toxic contaminants. Electrically-driven systems offer significant advantages such as integration with renewable energy, elimination of secondary pollutants or regeneration chemicals by being solely electrochemically regenerable, and modularity. However, recovery of platinum group metals (PGMs) and rare-earth elements (REEs) is a significant challenge for separations science because these elements are found as dilute ions in the presence of excess levels of competing species and with complex speciation depending on pH and ion concentration – and the applicability of electroseparations to REEs and PGMs is severely limited by the fundamental lack of molecular selectivity. This program will develop and implement efficient electrochemical systems for REE and PGM recovery by discovering new polymer-based electrode materials with innovative adsorbate–ion interaction modes, which provide highly selective yet reversible binding. Though typical design approaches employ energy storage materials or use trial­and­error, where machine learning (ML) trained on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental data will guide chemical selection, synthesis, and electrode ink creation to produce ion-selective yet processable redox­polymers. The simultaneous design of molecular binding and polymer secondary structure in a closed­loop can help accelerate downstream deployment of advanced redox­materials. MD­guided selection of polymer backbones and solvents that maximize ink stability, paired with advanced rheology and coating processes, will enable the creation of electrosorbents with desired macroscopic properties through scaleup, overcoming solubility and processing challenges typical of redox­polymers. Iteration between computation and experiments will produce a framework for rationally designing redox electrodes that, in addition to addressing critical element mixtures of direct relevance to mining and critical materials recycling, can be extended to address challenges in water desalination and environmental remediation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phosphorus plays a central role in biogeochemical cycles that broadly impact global biological productivity, food resources, and energy generation. Understanding the complex interrelationships between critical food, energy, and water resources and addressing phosphorus demand, pollution, and recovery are some of the greatest scientific challenges for future resources. At the root of these problems is the inability to measure phosphorus directly when and where one would like and to do so in a cost-effective manner. This technology gap precludes the ability to close the phosphorus cycle at regional, national, and global scales. This Growing Convergence Research project will overcome fundamental science, engineering, and prototyping challenges to enable portable, low-cost, robust, and selective sensors for phosphorus that address these critical and unmet needs. This project brings together researchers with expertise spanning supramolecular and inorganic chemistry, polymer science, soft-matter electronics, electrical engineering, and environmental and marine science. Convergent scientific, technological, and engineering advances will coalesce to realize new paradigms for control at the chemical, supramolecular, transduction, and device levels that will ultimately serve as the basis for ushering in a completely new generation of sensors for phosphorus. These sensors will satisfy the functional and economic requirements needed to provide pragmatic solutions for capturing the complexity of how phosphorus exists in space and time within agricultural landscapes, waterways, and ecosystems. Engagements with stakeholders, industrial partners, and government agencies will guide efforts towards additional applications, commercialization, and other societally relevant sensing challenges.<br/><br/>This convergent research program will integrate basic science and engineering approaches together and combine significant intellectual and technical overlap between traditionally disparate disciplines to address long-standing challenges that have limited the development of phosphorus sensing technologies. Specific objectives of the program are to: (1) design, develop and understand how molecular recognition elements (receptors) selectively bind phosphorus in the form of inorganic and organic phosphate compounds, (2) tailor receptor-analyte-semiconductor interactions and investigate how they specifically transduce the phosphate-binding events into a sensitive signal; (3) integrate these chemistries within low-cost electronic devices; (4) engineer sensors that enable sensitive quantification in complex environments for managing the phosphorus cycle including agricultural runoff, wastewater, and fresh, brackish, estuarine, and marine environments; (5) communicate chemical phosphate detection to electronic platforms to digitize and relay this data; and (6) develop prototypes for field use and demonstrations.

This work at HSIs is important because of the growing interest in how educators within HSIs are intentionally serving, rather than simply enrolling, students from minoritized backgrounds and attending to different subgroups within Hispanic/Latinx communities. Understanding how to support instructors to break with the norm of “neutrality” should create more welcoming environments for students with a range of identities and increase student belongingness, interest, and retention in STEM.<br/><br/>This project plans to employ a mixed methods (interviews and surveys), multi-site case study approach at five HSIs. Three goals guide the execution of the project. The first is to characterize how undergraduate biology instructors at HSIs make decisions about if and how to include identity-affirming content in their courses and the various factors that influence these decisions. Second is to establish how identity-affirming content in biology impacts student experiences, such as belongingness, interest in biology content, and perceived content relevance. The third goal is to develop a survey instrument to capture student perceptions of the prevalence of different instructor approaches to biology instruction at HSIs. The project team will specifically focus on instructors’ use of identity-neutral or identity-affirming content in biology classes, and the impact this type of content has on students with minoritized identities. This project takes a novel research approach by examining instructors’ decisions regarding both content and pedagogy, a more holistic approach to understanding how instructors create identity-affirming environments.

One of the major knowledge gaps is understanding how soluble forms of these metals are generated and transported to the surface ocean. Many trace elements are insoluble in seawater and precipitate close to their sources unless they are bound to a dissolved organic molecule, or ligand, that keeps the metal in solution. Little is currently known about what these ligands are, where they come from, or how they affect the reactivity and fate of metals in the Southern Ocean.

As part of this effort, the investigators will assess biological ligand production as the ecosystem shifts from low productivity iron-starved conditions in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to higher productivity along the upwelling continental margin, with a particular focus on assessing production within the Amundsen Sea polynya blooms and sinking organic matter remineralization zones. Second, changes in the accumulation, saturation, and composition of ligands in Circumpolar Deep Water will be measured as the water passes across the Antarctic shelf and receives inputs from sediments and glacial meltwaters.

As a result of this rapid expansion, we anticipate a network of more than 50 billion interconnected smart systems, encompassing intelligent appliances, cars, gadgets, and tools. These systems possess the capability to collect extensive real-time data, perform complex computational tasks, and deliver valuable services and actionable insights, greatly enriching our lives and collective productivity. Essential components of these smart systems include distributed sensors, communication modules, as well as analytical and computational modules. These components are intricately intertwined and rely on each other. Overall, there is a natural synergy between different sensing technologies, their applications, and methodologies developed in analytical areas. The objective of the proposed workshop is to identify significant research and educational challenges pertaining to these areas related to smart sensing technologies. <br/><br/>More specifically, the workshop aims to address significant research gaps in how researchers approach problems and formulate solutions in sensing applications while integrating tools and algorithms from analytical areas. Overall, the workshop aims to foster collaboration, knowledge exchange, and innovation between experts from various fields to advance the understanding and application of analytical tools in sensing systems. The main goals and areas of focus are as follows: <br/><br/>1 )Aligning the State-of-the-Art of Analytical Areas: The workshop aims to bridge the gap between various scientific fields, academia, and industry in data science, particularly machine learning, by presenting the cutting-edge computational and analytical capabilities in a way that is understandable to the sensing community. It seeks to establish effective methods to keep sensing system researchers updated on advancements in analytical areas and make these practices available in a publicly accessible repository. <br/><br/>2) Appreciating Algorithmic Limitations & Application Requirements: The workshop recognizes that the direct application of advanced algorithms from analytical areas to sensing systems can be distracting and limited, especially when considering the physical constraints inherent in sensing systems. Researchers need to develop customized computational and analytical tools that respect these constraints and align with specific application requirements.<br/> <br/>3) Application-Specific Sensor Systems: The workshop acknowledges the broad range of sensors used in various applications and aims to develop new sensors or integrate existing ones to meet specific application requirements. It brings together experts from different fields to define and deliver technologies that address performance, cost, sampling, environmental, deployment, data collection, and ease-of-use needs in sensor systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet many rural regions have few if any attorneys. The resulting gap between common civil issues like debt collection, domestic violence, and eviction on the one hand, and access to legal assistance on the other, is profoundly consequential to community resilience and health. These consequences are amplified in Alaska, where only 1.13 attorneys are available for every 10,000 Alaskans in poverty. In response, Alaska Legal Services Corporation recently developed the community justice worker (CJW) program, which trains individuals embedded in Alaska’s rural communities to provide formal legal advocacy and practice insights. By scaling up the CJW program, this project is directly addressing the civil legal needs of rural and Indigenous communities in Alaska. It is also contributing to local health and welfare, regional economic empowerment, and transformative legal aid delivery practices across the U.S.<br/><br/>Leveraging scientific and policy insights, regional expertise, and local relationships, the project team is: 1) Developing formal training, supervising, and credentialing processes for CJWs; 2) Growing best practices for recruiting and retaining CJWs and for workforce development; 3) Testing short- and long-term sustainability models for CJW infrastructure; and 4) Creating a framework for evaluation and evidence-based practices. Through rigorous, mixed-methodological data collection (qualitative interviews, survey and training data), continuous review and engagement with local stakeholders and Community Advisory Board members, and ongoing development and testing of a CJW evaluation metric that abides by the principles of Indigenous data sovereignty and policy, this project is at once advancing science, law, and justice. It is also contributing to legal aid efforts by demonstrating that a culturally-appropriate, spatially-responsive, and people-centered model of legal service delivery is possible.<br/><br/>The CIVIC Innovation Challenge is a collaboration with Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, in pharmaceutical tablet formulation development, traditional strategies can be slow and expensive, and product quality is not always guaranteed upon scale-up.  The proposed technology is designed to address these problems by providing a powder compressibility model and method for characterizing powder mechanical properties.  This may be used to extract more information, lower characterization time from hours to minutes, reduce equipment costs, and reduce the amount of powder required for characterization by an order of magnitude.  This information may inform key decision makers responsible for derisking the process and ensuring commercial product success. In addition, this technology may be applied to other industries that use powder compaction including metal part and cosmetic manufacturing, detergent tablet production, and construction in soil sciences and geotechnical engineering.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an additive powder compressibility model that unifies several existing materials science models to characterize powder compressibility.  The proposed model has been evaluated using materials with highly diverse mechanical properties. The comprehensive characterization deconvolutes the complex powder compaction process using in-die measurements, resulting in a fast, accurate, and materials-sparing characterization of important material properties that may inform formulation decisions. Deconvolution of these mechanical properties, such as plasticity and elasticity, allows for a more intrinsic understanding of the material and strengthens the understanding of the relationship between structure and property, which is essential for designing quality into a product.  The proposed powder compression characterization method and analysis may be used to capture more accurate and detailed information using only tens of milligrams of material and seconds to collect.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, predicting how plants and soils will respond remains uncertain. The project, DRAGNet (Disturbance and Recovery Across Grasslands Network), aims to address this by coalescing over 120 scientists from 93 grassland sites across Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. All scientists will conduct identical soil disturbance and nutrient addition experiments to understand how and where grassland communities respond to repeated disturbances and increased nutrients, how grasslands will recover from disturbance, and why similar places exhibit different responses to these changes. DRAGNet requires relatively low investment of time and money from individual researchers, enabling contributions from ecologists globally. The findings from DRAGNet will be shared through publications, educational materials, and public talks. Coordination of this collaborative, global research network will provide deeper understanding of how ecosystems respond to disturbances and changes caused by human activities across the globe to better protect and preserve, both, wild and human-occupied environments.<br/><br/>As a research coordination network, DRAGNet will allow comparisons of community responses in different grassland environments by coordinating identically replicated, factorial experiments manipulating soil disturbance and elemental nutrient supply at sites around the world. The data on plant and soil responses, collected following identical methods, will support tests of hypotheses about vegetation and biogeochemical resistance, the tendency to remain unchanged when disturbed, and recovery, the speed of return to a pre-disturbance state. By coordinating replicated experiments across site conditions, DRAGNet data will also uniquely clarify the context-dependence of post-disturbance responses on site history and conditions. In addition to testing hypotheses arising from ecological theory, project data will support development of a framework for understanding herbaceous system responses to these environmental changes by comparing recovery trajectories among diverse site conditions. The network will have four in-person and four virtual meetings to bring contributors together to analyze data, test hypotheses, and advance theoretical frameworks. In concert with scientific advances, the DRAGNet collaboration, especially the meetings, will serve to advance research and facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing in the global scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Between 2003 and 2020, 8.9% (4,889) of medical devices in the US were recalled due to issues that could cause serious health problems or even death. These recalls impact patient outcomes, and both device manufacturers and health insurers incur large financial losses. Timely prediction of recalls may benefit multiple stakeholders in the healthcare system. However, manufacturers presently rely on their own lab studies, proprietary data, and customer feedback to evaluate device safety and predict recalls.  The proposed technology uses advanced data analytics to study the history of adverse events of medical devices and performs predictive modeling for recalls.  This data analytics-based system may improve the evaluation of medical device recall likelihood with benefits to patients, medical device manufacturers, insurers, regulators, and other stakeholders by avoiding malfunctions and device recalls.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a data analytics platform that uses historical data from multiple data sources to visualize and analyze medical device recall likelihood.  The proposed technology is an online decision support system that uses data analytics to extract insights from FDA’s 510(k) device approval files to study and predict recalls. The proposed system uses natural language processing to automatically extract relevant information from device files and performs predictive modeling for medical device recalls using supervised machine learning.

This project will develop a prototype position measurement sensor useful for a wide variety of piston-cylinder actuators. The project will build on previous NSF research in which a position sensor suitable for small-stroke non-ferrous actuators was developed. While the previous invention has been successfully licensed to an industrial partner, it works well only for small stroke (up to 15 cm) applications. The fundamental research described in this proposal will enable enhancement of the sensing technology so as to provide accurate measurements over long stroke lengths. This will open up a large market for the sensor, including the long-stroke ferrous hydraulic actuators utilized on agricultural and construction vehicles.<br/><br/>The proposed project will conduct research to develop technology that enables the non-contacting sensor to work for long-stroke applications in ferrous actuators. This requires addressing several fundamental challenges, including the lack of accuracy and lack of robustness of previous estimation algorithms based on the extended Kalman filter which relied on linearization of nonlinear magnetic field models. Other technical challenges include the presence of significant hysteresis in the magnetic field model due to the ferrous cylinder being made of soft steel which gets magnetized and demagnetized in real time from the oscillatory motion of the internal magnet, and the requirement to daisy-chain multiple sensors for a multi-output nonlinear system in which only subsets of the sensors can be utilized in piecewise regions of operation of the sensor system. Solutions to address these challenges will be developed in the project.  The proposed solutions include rigorous development of nonlinear-observer-based estimation algorithms that provide both global asymptotic stability as well as rejection of disturbances and noise, development of a new analytical model for hysteresis that has significant advantages over the traditional Preisach model, and a systematic design methodology to address sensor switching and daisy chaining of sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Equitable data science investigates how biases in the data, the analysis of the data, and the interpretation of results can reinforce long-standing inequalities in our society and also create new inequities and disparities. Thus, it is critical to train the next generation of data scientists to develop methods and analyze data responsibly. This interdisciplinary project will provide undergraduate students with training in equitable data science to build their research skills in data science, statistical modeling and machine learning, and scientific communication. Through this training the students will learn how data sources, analysis methods, and the interpretation of results can reflect, reinforce, and mitigate systemic inequalities. The students will be trained to prioritize equity when approaching data-centered projects. These projects will lead to publicly-available software and reports that bring awareness to societal inequities and inform discussions on how to address them. Finally, the students will disseminate their work via a community event, which will inspire future research and connect the community with equity-related research. <br/><br/>Developing skills in equitable data science are invaluable towards enhancing scientific rigor while balancing fairness and equity in scientific research. During the 10-week program, students will build research skills in equitable data science and answer equity-oriented research questions about adolescent development using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Topics on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and their role in data science form the foundations of this program, emphasized early through DEI modules and discussions. Students will learn the causes and consequences of social inequality and how these inequalities manifest themselves in scientific research, from the data itself to the interpretation of results. The program continues with extensive technical training in R for programming, statistical modeling, and data visualization. Weekly workshops will provide technical training on topics ranging from statistics and machine learning to large-scale programming. Seminars and professional development events will be held every other week so that students will hear from researchers about their work on social and health inequities, prepare students for graduate school or the job market, and provide students with networking opportunities. Hackathons will also be held every other week so that students can gain experiences in equitable data science beyond the data from the ABCD Study. The 10-week program culminates in a public-facing event, giving the students the opportunity to present their work to the community and engage with the community in dialogue around DEI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the US, 1.9 million people are diagnosed with cancer annually, with an average of 609,000 deaths. Currently, the healthcare reimbursement system mostly relies on patients presenting symptoms, except for cancers of the breast or colon where there is proactive screening. However, detecting cancer early is critical to improving quality of life, decreasing patient morbidity, and reducing healthcare costs but available blood tests and imaging methods are not specific enough to elucidate most early cancer occurrences.  The proposed technology is a blood-based cancer diagnostic that may be administered to patients during annual checkups as well as to enhance imaging tests for cancer. It uses an array of antibodies conjugated to liposomes, a tiny bubble made from cell membrane-like materials, enabling them to bind to cancer cells with high specificity. By detecting cancers earlier with the proposed liposomal-antibody technology, there is the potential to improve patients’ quality of life, decrease patient morbidity, and reduce costs related to healthcare.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of cancer screening technology for the detection of early-stage cancers.  The proposed technology is a liposomal-antibody platform envisioned as for imaging assistance that may be given to patients before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) scans similar to the way general MRI contrast dye or tracers are administered to patients currently.  The liposomes are designed to have antibodies attached to the outer membrane that will enable them to congregate around tumor cells and will encapsulate imaging dyes to assist radiologists in detecting cancerous growth.  In addition, the proposed blood-based detection system may be administered to patients during annual checkups. An array of engineered antibodies may be embedded into liposomes enabling them to bind to diseased cells with high specificity and avoid attachment to healthy cells. The liposomes are designed to contain cell-free expression systems for multiple, unique peptides that encode signaling molecules.  This combination may enable screening for many different cancers at the microscopic level and monitoring their growth over time.  The proposed technology also may be used to monitor and quantify treatment efficacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 90% of REEs are mined in Asia and Africa. A global demand for REEs is causing supply shortages that are slowing down manufacturing in the US. This makes the US economy vulnerable. Current REE mining processes also have major impacts on the environment because they create massive amounts of harmful waste while consuming vast amounts of energy and water. The goal of this project is to develop an environmentally friendly biomining technology to extract REEs from US national resources. To advance this goal, the investigators propose to develop a bacterial system that can efficiently extract REEs from mining, industrial, and electronic wastes at an industrial level. The project will engage the public to address concerns about mining and biotechnology. The successful completion of this project will benefit society by developing fundamental knowledge on sustainable REE extraction. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through education and training, including the mentoring of two postdoctoral researchers and one graduate student at the University of Minnesota, one postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and one graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>Transitioning to clean energy systems and technologies has resulted in a surge in demand for rare earth elements (REEs), causing a significant supply shortage that already negatively impacts US industries, especially the EV market. Innovative extraction and recycling technologies that can access underutilized resources are needed to establish a diversified supply chain that does not solely rely on importing these critical elements. Today’s REE extraction and processing practices are energy intensive and cause significant environmental impacts through waste generation. This project aims to create a bio-based platform for engineering of resilient biofilms to extract REEs from various waste streams and mine-impacted waters for recovery, recycling, and decontamination. Specifically, the project team proposes to (1) engineer robust, artificial biofilm consortia that are environmentally safe and have controllable properties for selective metal binding under industrially relevant operational conditions, (2) design and model a bioreactor system to achieve economic feasibility and future deployment, and (3) pair technology development with public engagement to characterize values held by different stakeholders to inform acceptance of new biotechnologies in mining impacted regions. The successful completion of this project has the potential to have transformative impact through the creation of a biofilm-based system that is environmentally friendly and can sustainably extract/recycle/recover minerals and metals critical for clean-energy economy. Additional benefits include the development of a knowledge base and systems for the design of new living biofilms beyond biomining applications, such as bioremediation and biomanufacturing.

2321144,Effects of 3-D Mantle Wedge Flow and Crystal Preferred Orientation on Shear-Wave Splitting in Subduction Zones,EAR,Geophysics,09/01/2023,06/22/2023,Ikuko Wada,MN,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Standard Grant,Wendy Panero,08/31/2026,"$210,288.00",,iwada@umn.edu,2221 UNIVERSITY AVE SE STE 100,MINNEAPOLIS,MN,554143074,6126245599,GEO,157400,,$0.00,"The Earth’s mantle is solid, but it flows very slowly under high pressure and temperature, like a thick fluid. This flow affects important geological processes such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but it occurs too far below the Earth’s surface to be observed directly. In subduction zones, where oceanic plates descend below continents, mantle flow patterns are thought to be very complex. Though these patterns can be estimated using computer models, we need real data to check their accuracy. One way to indirectly obtain mantle flow data is to use seismic waves that are generated by earthquakes. Seismic waves that travel through the mantle are affected by fine layering that forms when mantle minerals line up in response to flow. Recordings of such waves at the Earth’s surface can be interpreted to identify mantle regions where minerals are lined up, showing what the flow patterns look like in 3D (at least, in parts of the mantle that many of the recorded seismic waves have passed through). In this study, Dr. Wada and her group will develop computer models of mantle flow in selected subduction zones, and predict how mantle minerals should line up. Next, they will use different software to predict what seismic waves travelling through this model mantle should look like when they reach the Earth’s surface. By comparing these predictions with data from seismometers, they can test the model and fully describe the geometry of mantle flow. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral scholar and an undergraduate student in seismology and scientific computer programming. The software and scientific results will be used in an undergraduate geophysics course at Minnesota and will be freely and publicly shared. <br/><br/><br/>One of the indirect observations that are used to infer mineral orientations and mantle flow directions are shear-wave splitting (SWS) observations. Minerals in the mantle, in particular olivine, become aligned relatively to the mantle flow direction, developing crystal preferred orientations (CPO). Shear waves that are generated by earthquakes travel through the upper mantle and become polarized into two orthogonal components that travel at different speeds. Measurements of the polarization direction of the fast component and the delay time between the two components provide information about the CPO of minerals in the mantle and thus the mantle flow pattern. However, the interpretation of the SWS parameters (i.e., the fast direction and the delay time) in terms of CPO and mantle flow directions is not trivial, and large uncertainties remain, particularly in subduction zones with oblique plate convergence that induces complex mantle wedge flow patterns. The previously funded project generated a suite of 3-D steady-state coupled kinematic-dynamic models for generic subduction systems with a range of subduction obliquity to examine its effect on the mantle wedge flow pattern. The model-predicted variation in mantle wedge flow pattern with the local subduction obliquity allowed prediction of along-margin variations in the mantle wedge flow pattern based on the local subduction obliquity, for subduction zones worldwide. Using calculated steady-state mantle velocity fields, the evolution of olivine and pyroxene CPOs in the mantle wedge was simulated. The calculated distributions of CPO were fed into the forward modeling of SWS. The results highlighted the complex evolution of CPOs in the mantle wedge for different CPO types and their impact on the SWS parameters. The proposed study is aimed to fill the gaps in the previous work through the following three activities: (1) Quantifying the variations in the CPO distribution and SWS parameters due to along-margin variations in the margin strike and the slab geometry. (2) Testing the model-predicted SWS parameters against observed SWS parameters in NE Japan where sufficient detailed SWS analyses have been performed. (3) Investigating the relative importance of the impact of transtensional and transpressional strains in the mantle wedge during slab rollback and advance on the CPO evolution and SWS. The results provide foundational understanding of the impacts of subduction zone geometry and slab motion on deformation and CPO evolution in the mantle wedge and the dependence of SWS parameters on the CPO distribution. The synthesis of the results with those from the previously funded project will be used to address the observed variations in SWS parameters within and among subduction systems globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This equipment will make these facilities more resilient against helium shortages, rationing, and supply disruptions (and the associated impacts on cost). As a result, these actions will maximize the use of instrumentation without interruption and expand the laboratories’ scientific output, as well as benefiting numerous NSF-funded projects, and improving the sustainability and resilience of two key research centers. Measurements in these laboratories are crucial for characterizing and understanding the magnetic properties of geological, biological, planetary, and novel synthetic materials related to a broad range of scientific questions. Helium is a finite resource and it is imperative that proper stewardship, including helium gas recovery and cryogen-free functionality become commonplace. The dependence on non-renewable cryogens has made both laboratories vulnerable to shortages, as well as increasing annual operating costs. The IRM and NMR Laboratory are at a critical juncture where helium shortages and associated supply quotas have already reduced operations and pose increasing uncertainty on scheduled activities. The ongoing shortage has severely limited our ability to serve the broader scientific community and advance cutting-edge research. The new equipment will reduce or eliminate the need for LHe for critical equipment in our facilities. This will allow the facilities to maximize the use of its instruments without interruption, further expanding the laboratories’ scientific output, benefit numerous NSF funded projects, and improve the sustainability and resilience of two key research centers. <br/><br/>Both facilities are dependent on uninterrupted supplies of liquid Helium (LHe) for the operations of superconducting magnets, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers, and variable temperature 57Fe Mössbauer spectrometers for measurements that are crucial for characterizing and understanding the magnetic properties of geological, biological, planetary, and novel synthetic materials. The low-temperature (2-300 K) magnetic properties of natural materials, their synthetic analogues, and novel materials are indispensable for understanding a broad range of scientific questions, with low-temperature measurements providing observations not obtainable through any other methods. NMR spectroscopy is the most powerful technique available for the elucidation of molecular structures. Its many uses include determining the arrangement of atoms within molecules and characterizing the dynamics of molecular interactions in solution. Preserving the functionality of LHe equipment is essential to the operation of (1) the IRM as an NSF multi-user facility for national and international researchers; and (2) the NMR Laboratory as a shared-use instrumentation facility for research and teaching at the UMN.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, we can solve equations using geometry (by finding where lines, planes, curves intersect).  These ideas have evolved into algebraic geometry, a field of modern mathematics with applications ranging from physics to cybersecurity.  In this collaborative project we are particularly interested in the connections to physics.  These connections are made through “derived categories”, a complex system of mathematical data associated to a geometric shape.  While derived categories have experienced explosive development in recent decades, many questions about them remain unsolved.   This project attempts to solve some of the central and most recent questions about derived categories using techniques developed by the principal investigators and many others over the last decade.  This award will also support undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three specific questions about derived categories.  Together, these questions incorporate numerous areas of mathematics including birational geometry, enumerative geometry, and non-commutative algebra.   Specifically, our first question studies connections between derived categories and birational geometry (and the possibly concealed connection between flips/flops and derived partial compactifications).  We ask whether K-equivalent varieties have equivalent derived categories, a central conjecture about derived categories due to Bondal-Orlov and Kawamata.  Our second question asks how decompositions of quantum cohomology are related to semi-orthogonal decompositions of derived categories.  This connection is conjecturally made through mirror symmetry as proposed by Kontsevich and Kuznetsov.  Finally, our third question asks how derived categories shed light on resolutions of singularities (namely as moduli spaces coming from non-commutative algebra).  Here, we aim to construct non-commutative crepant resolutions using ideas from homological mirror symmetry.  The existence of these resolutions has been conjectured by Van den Bergh.  As a whole, this project aims to interpolate between these three questions/conjectures using techniques from geometric invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, derived algebraic geometry, and mirror symmetry. The central theme is the explicit use and construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels whose geometry provides a foothold into understanding these problems.  Combining the past work of the principal investigators on the construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels, wall crossing for derived categories, and virtual fundamental cycles, we expect to advance our understanding of these fundamental questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The strong carbon-halogen bonds resulting from halogens being potent oxidants have resulted in a contamination challenge with a daunting legacy. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were globally banned 30 years ago to close the Antarctic ozone hole, persist in the atmosphere. Additionally, there are over 9000 poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) currently contaminating rainwater worldwide, and polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics account for more than 50% of chlorine found in municipal waste. Today, xenobiotic organohalogen compounds are pervasive: PFAS-contaminated water is consumed by 200 million Americans and PVC is the primary contributor to the nation’s annual dioxin burden, surpassing that of any other industrial product. To address this legacy contamination challenge, a step change solution is required, one that surpasses the limited scope of current thermochemical technologies. In this project, plasma-assisted dehalogenation is proposed as a disruptive solution to this challenge. The project focuses on the use of non-equilibrium plasmas for the degradation and recycling of halogen-containing waste and holds enormous potential for improving human health and preserving the environment. This convergent research project will provide unique opportunities for interdisciplinary STEM education and training and prepare a diverse pipeline of students and researchers to become the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers. Planned outreach activities involve the development of hands-on activities for K-12 programs, with a focus on at-risk and often underrepresented students. The effort involves partnerships with industry to further technological development and activities that raise awareness among local communities about the pervasive presence of halogen-containing compounds and the associated health and safety challenges they pose.<br/><br/>The goal of the research is to probe at a mechanistic level plasma-assisted dehalogenation reaction chemistry and to use these insights to develop innovative processes that make possible recycling of reaction products or the full mineralization of haloginated components. Non-equilibrium plasma refers to a partially ionized gas operating at near ambient temperatures, where only the electrons possess kinetic energies high enough to enable the production of short-lived reactive species which act as initiators for chain reactions of various substrates. This convergent research program leverages the PIs’ expertise in chemical reaction engineering, plasma science, chemical modeling and theory, and environmental engineering to establish a plasma dehalogenation model that will be used to design a reactor for plasma-assisted dehalogenation of waste streams with a focus on PFAS and PVC as two testbed cases. The successful completion of this research will lead to new fundamental scientific insights and engineering solutions contributing to a broader framework for dehalogenating a wide range of waste streams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cave environments provide natural laboratories to study how organisms can live without abundant food sources and in constant darkness. Cave animals have undergone shifts in their metabolism, sleep patterns, and sensory systems and can inform the understanding of these basic biological processes.

However, predictive sediment transport equations that account for the impacts of biofilms are lacking. A key challenge in developing such predictive equations is that the transport of sediment at macroscale (> 1 m) is controlled by biofilms at micro (10^-6 to 10^-3 m) to mesoscale (10^-3 to 10^-1 m). This study aims to combine micro- to mesoscale flow-cell and imaging technology with macroscale flume experiments to quantify the impacts of micro- to mesoscale biofilms on macroscale sediment transport.

Unfortunately, biologically ‘tricking’ neurons to reconnect with former targets has been met with limited success. Might there be another way of activating locomotor spinal circuitry below the site of injury? Our newest experiments in the medicinal leech indicate that the remodeling of the stretch-sensitive neurons, activated during the elongation and shortening phases of crawling behavior, are likely key to the understanding of how locomotor circuits are once again turned on and contribute to coordinated locomotion. Our work provides a rare and unique opportunity to explore how a novel sensory-based circuit design replaces a centrally-based governing system for the initiation and coordination of locomotion. Importantly, we can examine the cellular basis of this switch in the same individuals over time. This flexibility in design should have significant ramifications for the creation of locomoting robotic systems, especially those that are soft-bodied like the leech. Our research is highly interdisciplinary and will involve the use of innovative molecular and anatomical approaches to understanding neuronal plasticity; we also aim to include citizen-scientists and other volunteers around the globe in our research. The PI and Co-PI will continue to develop ways to support college students and scientists in their labs, and through the development of new initiatives through their respective scientific organizations.<br/><br/>Our interdisciplinary team will explore how novel neural circuits, in the medicinal leech, emerge and orchestrate a recovery of locomotion after the nerve cord and brain become separated. When descending inputs from the brain neuron R3b-1 are removed, crawling is completely lost, yet surprisingly returns after about 2 weeks. Our goal is to study the underlying circuit design that accounts for this restored crawling. Key to crawl recovery are the proprioceptive stretch receptors (SRs) that pepper each body-wall segment. These proprioceptors, although not injured themselves, sprout new centrally-located (and intersegmental) output branches that are predicted to target crawl-related circuitry, especially in the ‘lead’ ganglion directly below the site of nerve cord injury. We will use electrophysiological recording, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, and electron microscopy to interrogate the role of the lead ganglion and SRs in establishing crawl recovery. To study changes in gene expression across neurons in the lead and adjacent ganglia, and in the SRs, we will use spatial transcriptomics, whereby genome-wide expression analysis will be mapped back to precise locations in specific ganglia and SR processes obtained from histological sections. Our methods and instrumentation, at our respective institutions, will allow for subcellular localization of mRNA molecules in somata, neuronal processes (intrinsic and extrinsic), and synaptic terminals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In another direction, the PI will work with undergraduates to further our understanding of cubulation in Gromov random groups; in particular they will increase the known bound for cocompact actions on CAT(0) cube complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Islands such as Madagascar are often considered natural laboratories to study how species evolved in isolated environments. Given their smaller size, island ecosystems are also highly vulnerable to extinction. This research project will test fundamental theories of how species adapt, diversify, and respond to extinction risks using the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar, with extraordinary species found nowhere else on the planet. Additionally, the research will develop a new framework for studying the genomic changes that allow the evolution of extreme morphological and functional adaptations to environmental change. For example, some Malagasy bird lineages are considered adaptive radiations because they exhibit dramatic features that likely evolved due to new ecological opportunities. This project will help further our knowledge of the genomic foundations that determine form and function in the evolution of biodiversity. Moreover, this award will support collaboration between diverse researchers of varied career stages and interests, foster partnerships between international institutions, and promote undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>This research integrates phylogenetics, biogeography, genomics, and conservation to address two main objectives. First, using an innovative model that incorporates island biogeographic parameters with phylogenetic diversification, this study will investigate the macroevolutionary consequences of extinction risk in the Malagasy avifauna. Madagascar is a unique biogeographic system that combines both island and continental processes; this project will test the broad applicability of diversification models and also inform conservation assessments in this highly threatened biodiversity hotspot. Second, this project will use comparative genomics to integrate genotype-phenotype analyses in adaptive radiations. With a focus on three Malagasy endemic groups, this project will catalyze research into the underlying genomic architecture of ecological and morphological variation to better understand the origins and functions of various traits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge arises in a wide range of applications, and rich methodologies for reconstructing this unseen information are employed in various fields, including geophysics, medical imaging, biology, solar physics, remote sensing and machine learning. The main goal of this project is to advance the understanding of reconstructing hidden properties from measurable data. This project specifically aims to investigate fundamental questions and devise reconstruction methods to uncover unknown coefficients in kinetic equations, including the Boltzmann equation, which describes the dynamics of dilute gases with binary collisions, and the Fokker-Planck equation, used to describe the dynamics in a plasma. Mathematical tools will be developed to provide a theoretical understanding of emerging topics on these inverse problems. Moreover, the project integrates research and education, providing training and research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to conduct fundamental research on nonlinear kinetic equations and associated partial differential equation models in both the forward and inverse frameworks. The work consists of three primary goals. The first goal centers on analyzing three nonlinear time dependent equations, the Boltzmann equation, the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation, and a transport equation, with the goal of retrieving the unknown collision kernel and coefficients based on measurements taken on the boundaries. The second goal aims to uniquely and stably recover diffusion, absorption, and source coefficients from boundary measurements using the Fokker-Planck equation. The third goal involves an analysis of the Wigner equation and Schrödinger equations, with the purpose of understanding the relationship between quantum and classical mechanics. Due to the wide variety of kinetic equations across applications, novel ideas and analytical techniques will be designed to suit their distinct features, such as transport and interaction. This research will improve the mathematical understanding of inverse kinetic theory and related topics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will contribute new and validated, high-fidelity designs for the fundamental mechanisms Wikipedia uses to organize knowledge, with the goal of enriching the types of knowledge it includes and expand the evidentiary standards it employs. Wikipedia's success rests on a radical knowledge production process—anyone can edit the articles—coupled with a strict evidentiary epistemology that mandates ""reliable sources"" and a ""neutral point of view"". But along with the success has come systematic problems and controversies over what knowledge is ""valid."" These processes may have the effect of excluding much valuable knowledge, including (1) knowledge based on different ways of knowing, such as oral histories; (2) less established knowledge, including emerging knowledge about new medical treatments and therapies; and (2) knowledge directed toward different goals, for example personal experiences that contextualize textbook knowledge. These exclusions occur through the decisions of Wikipedia editors: which edits they allow and which they undo and what rules they enforce. <br/><br/>Research will fill the theory-practice gap in Wikipedia research via well-evaluated, high-fidelity prototypes that can change the evidentiary practices in the online encyclopedia. This goal will be accomplished through four phases of work: Phase 1: Translate theory and practice into low-fidelity prototypes for new knowledge representations. Phase 2: Validate initial designs with a small panel of Wikipedia experts. Phase 3: Develop the most promising ideas from Phase 2 into high-fidelity, functional prototypes. Phase 4: Evaluate the high-fidelity prototypes through an asynchronous online community for design critique and generation. Expected scientific outcomes of this project include new design prototypes and policies for Wikipedia that expand and enrich its knowledge-production epistemology, and expert and stakeholder insights into the potential feasibility, efficacy, and acceptability of the designs and policies. This multi-stage, iterative design process is applicable to other complex and risky arenas, such as designing interventions for credibility assessment in social platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It carries out the vital function of pumping oxygenated blood around the body. This process is preceded by the electrical communication between cardiac cells. It is widely accepted that gap junctional coupling is the primary mechanism for the electrical conduction. Nevertheless, recent experimental observation raised the concern of whether conduction can be sustained in the absence of gap junctions. Ephpatic coupling (EpC) is an electric field effect developed at the intercalated disc (ID) between adjacent cells, which has been suggested as an alternative way in mediating intercellular electrical communication when gap junctions are impaired. However, the direct experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of EpC is still absent. Therefore, attempts were made to indirectly demonstrate the existence of EpC by revealing its physiological role in the heart. This collaborative proposal aims for developing the very first multiscale model to incorporate the heterogeneous nanoscale ID structure into a two-dimensional discrete model with multidomain electrodiffusion of multiple ions. This framework seamlessly bridges biophysical responses of different space and time scales, which helps understand the potential impact of EpC on arrhythmogenesis in the heart. Therefore, the proposed research is highly inter- disciplinary and provides a bridge between mathematical modeling and cardiac electrophysiology. Moreover, this study is of high clinical significance, which lays a solid ground for developing anti-arrhythmic strategies and therapies for patients with structurally abnormal hearts, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy. The project is a collaboration between Purdue University and the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained and will collaborate in multidisciplinary environment via joint meetings.<br/><br/>This project will develop the very first multiscale discrete model of EpC through integration of the nanoscale structure of ID into the healthy and is- chemic heart. In particular, the following novel features will be incorporated to the model at different levels: (1) subcellular level: homogeneously and/or heterogeneously distributed EpC developed using a multi-compartment ID; (2) cellular level: electrodiffusion of multiple ions between multiple domains; (3) tissue level: complex anatomical structure of ischemic region incorporated in the heart. This framework is a system of ordinary algebraic differential equations with a significantly large number of nonlinear terms at different spatial and time scales. Therefore, an effective numerical scheme is required to reduce the computational cost at the tissue level. This proposal thus aims for developing an adaptive time stepping algorithm and designing a preconditioner for generalized minimal residual method to efficiently solve the system. This model will evaluate the impact of nanoscale structure of ID, various distributions of EpC, ionic electrodiffusion and complex structure of ischemic regions on initiation, termination and dynamics of cardiac arrhythmias. In order to validate the numerical findings and indirectly demonstrate the presence of EpC as an alternative mechanism of cell-to-cell communication in the heart, whole-heart animal experiments using high resolution optical mapping technique will be performed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite decades of searches, the nature of the dark matter is not yet known. As light passes through or close to a galaxy cluster, its path is bent by both the dark and luminous matter, and cluster lenses can create multiple, magnified images of background galaxies. In this project, scientists the University of Minnesota will measure the lensing magnification of mirrored images of ionized gas clouds in these background galaxies to carry out a new test of leading theories of dark matter. A second component of the program will be to seek to identify individual stars that are highly magnified in imaging from the upcoming Large Survey of Space and Time (LSST). These magnified stars are visible across most of the observable universe and studying them will open a new window into the universe when it was much younger. Moreover, changes in these stars’ brightness should provide new evidence about the nature of dark matter. In collaboration with the University of Minnesota’s Bell Museum, the team will also develop a new live-facilitated program for its 120-seat planetarium about past and current questions surrounding the cosmic expansion. The planetarium show, which will be targeted towards middle-school students but able to engage adults, will become a part of the Bell Museum’s regular daily rotation, and reach tens of thousands of students and visitors. <br/><br/>The research team will acquire ground-based spectroscopy of pairs of mirrored images of HII regions in magnified arcs. Differences between the brightnesses, and therefore magnifications, of these pairs of images must arise from dark-matter substructure, since the large sizes of HII regions imply that their fluxes are not affected by microlensing from stars in the foreground cluster. These measurements will be compared to predictions from both cold dark matter (CDM) and ultralight boson dark matter. The second goal of this project is to study stars at cosmological distances that are sufficiently magnified to be detected. The team will develop tools to identify these events in LSST data, and obtain follow-up spectroscopy and imaging to study the detailed properties of the luminous stars beyond the local universe. The stars’ light curves should contain rapid fluctuations if axion minihalos are present in the galaxy cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motion control and manipulation of objects present universal challenges in science and engineering. Conventional actuation mechanisms often require physical tethers or onboard energy sources, which can be cumbersome in practical applications in robotics, materials assembly, bioengineering, and biomedicine. Actuation by the radiation pressure of waves, such as acoustic waves, can be entirely contactless, but current techniques are limited to small, subwavelength objects. To overcome these limitations, this project will exploit the interaction of acoustic waves with engineered structures known as metasurfaces. The main idea is to envelop objects with surface patterns that are deliberately designed to control the momentum change of the actuating wave, that is, to control the direction and intensity of actuation, enabling to remotely move, steer, and manipulate these objects. The scientific research will be tightly integrated with education and outreach activities including hands-on demonstrations designed to broaden participation and expose students to science and engineering at the intersection of metamaterials and robotics.<br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to develop a foundational understanding of metasurface-controlled contactless dynamics. By utilizing metasurface patterns, it is possible to control the radiation pressure with high fidelity and high resolution at each location along the object’s surface. The objective of this research is to develop a bidirectional, forward and inverse, models that map between the desired object dynamics and metasurface patterns. By combining wave-physics analysis and finite-element simulations, this project will identify new metasurface topologies that are suitable as building blocks for contactless actuation. Modeling efforts will be supported by the fabrication and characterization of metasurface structures and tabletop experiments to demonstrate their dynamical behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the local level, options to disrupt these networks can be broadly categorized into two groups: (i) supply-side interdiction strategies, which focus on disrupting the drug flow into the communities, and (ii) demand-side interdiction strategies, which concentrate on reducing drug demand and on mitigating the health impacts of drug use within communities. Supply- and demand-side interdiction approaches are often seen as exclusive and competing approaches for handling the opioid epidemic. They are, however, synergistic as supply-side interdiction reduces the preponderance of drugs in communities whereas harm-reduction mitigates their adverse effects. Finding balance between these interventions is particularly crucial for counties as they house many important governmental functions in emergency, social, and public safety services. Driven by empirical investigations of opioid network features at the local level, this project aims to develop decision support models that are powered by new advances in machine learning and utility theory to help county policy makers allocate their resources effectively to combat this epidemic. The models will be validated using data collected from the state of West Virginia, which has been uniquely negatively affected by opioids. The project will provide support for graduate students, who will be trained in multidisciplinary approaches to address complex societal problems.<br/><br/>This project will link county expenditure data with available public health and public safety data on drug availability and use. In particular, the project (i) maps and compares West Virginia counties in terms of budgetary policy directions (supply-side, demand-side or both) and their relative success at disrupting the supply and demand for drugs in local communities and at reducing their negative health consequences and (ii) builds analytical models that tackle aspects of opioid network disruption at multiple state decision levels. These models will provide data-driven prescriptions for budget allocation taking into account three intrinsic challenges: (a) the forms of utilities of policymakers are not known exactly, (b) the health and safety consequences of budget decisions are complex nonlinear functions accessible through data, and (c) opioid networks adapt to policy decisions. Developed models and solution methodologies will build on recent developments in utility theory, machine learning, and optimization to provide local counties decision tools for policy prescriptions that can lead to optimal/improved outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly emphasized in the field of epileptology where epileptologists spend a substantial amount of their time on visually reviewing and interpreting lengthy multi-channel time series of brain electrical activity, called electroencephalography (EEG). This burden not only contributes to the escalation of epileptologist burnout, but also introduces reviewer bias and potential errors in clinical decisions. The goal of this proposal is to develop a machine-learning (ML)-based decision support framework that works together with epileptologists and focuses their attention to actionable information. We will leverage the computing expertise of Illinois and the clinical domain expertise of our collaborators at the Mayo Clinic and demonstrate significant innovations across the data-science lifecycle to achieve the aforementioned goal. The data and the methods utilized in this research will serve as examples in advanced interdisciplinary classes and training healthcare professionals. We also believe that the natural appeal of healthcare applications will stimulate the interest of undergraduates and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This research will develop a set of novel domain-guided analytical methods to process time-series EEG data, extract actionable information and provide clinical decision support for diagnosing epilepsy. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is in addressing an unmet need in the field of epileptology through the development of novel explainable machine learning architectures guided by clinical domain expertise. Our proposed work includes, a) development of a fully automated and efficient EEG preprocessing pipeline by leveraging the cheap inference capability of deep learning-based approaches; b) designing novel ML models, guided by domain expertise, that capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG data; c) interpretation of model predictions and quantification of prediction uncertainty for clinical decision support; and d) demonstration of the framework in the real world by developing a robust analytical tool to augment expert review of EEGs and improve the sensitivity of epilepsy diagnosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The science of ecological forecasting makes predictions about ecosystems in response to environmental change. Ecological forecasts in turn, aid in development of nature-based solutions for Earth's changing climate. Some forecasts have a large degree of uncertainty, such as those for terrestrial carbon cycling. Gains and losses of CO2 from the soil, known as soil efflux, are an important source of this uncertainty because they depend on climate inputs with a high degree of variability, such as temperature and precipitation. This research will develop open-access real-time forecasts of soil CO2 effluxes using mathematical and computational approaches. Forecasts will be developed across 47 long-term research sites in the continental United States that are part of the NSF-supported National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The principal investigator (PI), in partnership with a mentor from the NSF-supported Ecological Forecasting Initiative, will further develop a tool to address a community forecasting challenge for soil effluxes, leading to its broader adoption in the ecological community. The skills gained through this project will provide a long-term and sustainable research trajectory for the PI, and will help him develop new undergraduate research and training experiences. <br/><br/>Real-time forecasts of components of the terrestrial carbon cycle (i.e. gross primary productivity and net ecosystem carbon exchange) are important for understanding and developing nature-based solutions in a changing climate. Despite the importance of soil carbon storage to climate mitigation, standardized prediction of terrestrial soil carbon efflux across seasonal and interannual timescales lags behind other terrestrial carbon forecasts with increased model forecast uncertainty from a (current) lack of structural representation of soil processes. This project will develop forecasts for soil carbon efflux across seasonal and interannual timescales at all NEON terrestrial sites. Project deliverables include incorporation of a suite of soil carbon models (spanning a range of model complexity) into an integrated informatics toolbox for ecosystem modeling (the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer or PEcAn) to generate soil efflux forecasts. Modeled effluxes will be validated against existing measurements or databases (e.g. Soil Respiration Database or the Continuous Soil Respiration Database) where appropriate. This project will directly connect NEON data and ecological forecasting techniques with the broader ecological community. Developed methods and tools will be open-access for the scientific community,<br/>notably through an open-source R package and by incorporation of models into the PEcAn ecological informatics workflow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, traditional training courses rooted in the CSE sciences often lack the contextualized problem focus and hands-on access to tailor-made learning data and problem sets that are familiar to and thus useful for upskilling this particular sector of the workforce. This project proposes to develop and deploy a multi-module learning curriculum tailored to CI-applications in the agri-food sciences that is provided as a synchronous, virtual offering with substantial hands-on application-based learning opportunities. The challenges that the proposed work will be made generalizable, such that other left-behind communities seeking to capitalize on core advances in data science and HPC can leverage the approaches and infrastructure developed under this proposal.

The first three course modules provide the basic building blocks for HPC-based analytics, followed by a series of hands-on application modules that enable agri-food researchers with the levels of competency needed to facilitate HPC analyses of critical agri-food problems. The course will be accessible to academic (undergraduate, graduate, and faculty/staff) audiences around the US and abroad (especially targeting underrepresented populations of students), as well as individuals working in US government agencies and agri-business firms. To enable both academic and non-academic accessibility, this pilot project will host the CI-focused agri-food analytics curriculum on Microsoft Azure cloud computing infrastructure, but the course will introduce learners to the portfolio of available private, academic, and cloud-based HPC resources. The project team will work with internal and external agri-food networks and leverage the capabilities of the ACCESS Knowledge Base Ask.CI and/or Community Affinity Groups. The team will engage in a series of external and internal content and delivery audits throughout the grant period to ensure the identification of optimal HPC learning pathways for agri-food researchers.

Indeed one needs to design a new algorithm and develop the corresponding analysis specific to each application scenario and set of requirements. There has been an urgent need to unify various subclasses of distributed algorithms to provide insights and streamline the design and analysis. The framework developed in this project will benefit a wide range of applications beyond machine learning, such as control theory and signal processing. The proposed activities also offer rich opportunities for engaging undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary research and K-12 outreach activities.<br/><br/>This proposal advocates a generic “model” of distributed algorithms by leveraging theory and techniques from stochastic multi-rate feedback control systems. Such a generic model can abstract important features of distributed algorithms, such as guaranteed differential privacy, compressed communication, or occasional communication, into tractable modules. Building upon these abstract models, we design a framework with superior modeling power to encompass a substantial class of distributed algorithms. Such a framework can be used to analyze the entire algorithm class, but more importantly, it helps streamline the design of new algorithms in the sense that features arising from different application domains can be easily integrated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cosmic Explorer (CE), a concept for a next-generation gravitational-wave observatory in the United States, will push the reach of gravitational-wave astronomy to the edge of the observable universe, by using proven LIGO technology in a facility ten times larger than each LIGO observatory. CE will enable transformative discoveries across physics, astronomy, and cosmology, by observing black holes and neutron stars across cosmic time, probing the nature of the most extreme matter in the universe, and exploring questions in the nature of gravity and fundamental physics. This award supports research to identify and evaluate potential sites for CE, each necessarily substantially larger than LIGO’s sites. CE will do this while working in mutually beneficial, culturally supported partnerships with Indigenous and other local communities.<br/><br/>This award supports the identification and evaluation of the most promising locations for CE observatories while developing protocols and best practices for large-scale projects to be in partnership with local and Indigenous communities. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and public data will be used to identify and vet locations and then establish partnerships through the Indigenous Partnership Program (IPP). At locations that are physically viable and where community permission is granted, an initial assessment will be conducted; this and continued community consultation will inform a down-selection of locations for in-depth reference assessment. CE has knowledge of and access to LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO), where there are established protocols for partnering with local and Indigenous communities. The (broader) Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford area, on which LHO is located, will be the first location where the entire assessment process — from start to a thorough reference assessment — may be implemented. The combined location search and evaluation will constitute a prototype for the full approach, which can be used to continuously add promising CE locations in Phase 2 of conceptual design. These activities will implement an integrated, respectful framework for location evaluation, community consultation, and combined data- and community-driven understandings of facilities construction priorities. CE will enhance US scientific infrastructure, ensuring the US continues its leading role in gravitational-wave science while connecting science with society, especially in the context of Indigenous communities. These activities will create innovative, culturally supported pathways into STEM, support retention of members of historically excluded groups, prioritize the interests of Indigenous and local communities, and empower future leaders of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most abundant microbes in the gut are bacteria, and they are metabolically active and most of them are friendly or benign to the animal host. Like most organisms, bacteria also get infected by viruses, and these are known as bacteriophages or phages. One version of these phages is known to infect bacteria and integrate into their DNA as prophages, remaining in what is thought to be a dormant state. However, because of the genes they carry or the location of their integration, prophages can impact the behavior of bacteria and can increase their resistance to antibiotics. Despite the increased recognition of how animal microbiomes impact health, little is known about how prophages influence the structure and function of animal microbiomes. This project will leverage two model systems, an invertebrate chordate, Ciona robusta, and a vertebrate, the zebrafish Danio rerio to identify how prophages affect animal microbiomes. The project will integrate genetic, predictive modeling, and experimental approaches to study the biology and ecology of prophage influence on animal microbiomes. Data from this study will contribute to the understanding of factors shaping homeostasis within the gut of animals. Other broader impacts of this project include training and mentoring of students, some from underrepresented communities, in research on microbiology, bioinformatics, and immunology. The investigators will engage K-12 students with activities such as “Skype-a-Scientist” and an oceanography camp for girls. Additionally, the investigators will perform outreach to the general public at science festivals, museums, and farmer markets. <br/><br/>Most animals form essential relationships with bacteria. Bacteriophages (or ‘phages’) are viruses that infect these bacteria, and it is well established that through lysis, ‘lytic’ phages restructure bacterial communities while ‘temperate’ phages can integrate into bacterial genomes as ‘prophages,’ transforming their hosts into ‘lysogens’. Integration into bacterial genomes can influence nearby genes, while other viral genes or regulatory regions can influence bacterial physiology and fitness in a process referred to as ‘lysogenic conversion.’ However, compared to our significantly improved understanding of the diverse roles of bacteria in animal microbiomes, the impact of prophages on these communities remains largely overlooked. This proposal will test the hypothesis that prophages shape the biology of their bacterial hosts and drive structural and functional changes in animal microbiomes. Utilizing a combination of bacterial genome sequencing and molecular genetics while integrating ecological modeling and experimental approaches, the investigators will study the biology and ecology of lysogens in the microbiomes of two powerful model systems, the tunicate Ciona robusta, and the zebrafish Danio rerio. Specifically, the investigators will characterize prophage distribution and location in genomes of cultivated heterotrophs from model microbiomes, determine the influence of prophages on bacterial host properties (swimming, biofilm formation, growth / physiology) via targeted prophage deletion mutagenesis, and examine the role of prophages in shaping colonization and influencing the stability of the gut microbiome in vivo and in silico.

Small mammals in particular are more sensitive to habitat change than their larger relatives, so the team will examine this relationship over time and space to develop a robust understanding of how they respond to changing landscapes. This work is critical both to understanding how habitat changes in the past have shaped the animals living on the landscape and to developing models that will allow us to recognize and potentially mitigate impacts of current human-driven habitat alteration on mammalian species. The work will also integrate undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 teachers into the process, giving them all a view into ongoing research and disseminating the research results as the work is being conducted so it can advance public understanding of ecology and evolution. <br/><br/>The team will study patterns of habitat change and ecological evolution in the U.S. Great Plains and Northwest from 30 to 5 million years ago. They will collect fossil small mammals and sediment for phytolith extraction through fieldwork in the Northwest to build a record of the ecological structure of faunas and floras to compare with the well-studied Great Plains. Mammal diet, body size, and locomotion will be estimated from dental and skeletal proxies. These data will be used to compare the structure of small mammal communities to local habitat data inferred from phytolith assemblages, to determine the influence of changing habitats on faunal ecology. They expect that changes through time in habitat openness and heterogeneity will lead to differences in the guild structure of small mammals in those ecosystems. Differences in habitat changes between the study regions offer an opportunity to test the degree to which ecological responses of small mammals to habitat change are consistent and predictable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research suggests that learning is often better and longer lasting when students engage in well-scaffolded, shared, and collaborative learning experiences. However, educational technologies do not often leverage this research, with the focus most often being on the individual rather than a group. The CueLearn project will thus develop, test, and implement two intelligent strategies to improve students' collaborative problem solving: 1) facilitating effective student collaborations through the creation of effective peer groups within CueLearn, and 2) using real-time supports to increase student engagement and help students persist productively. The project's key aim is to design a system that will easily facilitate quality peer collaboration for all students, while also supporting teachers in their use of technology for collaborative work.<br/><br/>The project focuses on social learning experiences by automatically assigning students to work with optimized peer groups. Multiple grouping strategies will be tested through a series of observational studies and experiments to identify which grouping strategy works best. For example, students may be grouped based on their intended problem-solving strategy, so that students will be exposed to diverse approaches from peers who are using different strategies. However, intelligent student grouping methods may not be effective for learning by themselves, unless students are also provided with additional support during problem solving. Machine learning approaches will therefore be used to monitor engagement and detect unproductive forms of persistence in real-time in order to provide in-the-moment support as needed. Critically, these supports will be co-designed with students. Automated ideal grouping combined with just-in-time supports are hypothesized to improve students' problem solving performance and mathematical beliefs. Through all of these design innovations, the project aims to provide a new and effective educational technology for students and teachers.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Moreover, no one in the region (or in Kenya broadly), has the expertise, financial means, or availability to conduct this work. The team will carefully excavate and document these fossils, record and measure signs of interspecies aggression, and transport them to the National Museums of Kenya where they will be available to the global scientific community.

The test will be conducted early and accurately using a simple blood draw. Twenty percent of cancer patients will experience cancer recurrence. Unfortunately, cancer recurrence is not diagnosed until years after initial treatment when the cancer has often metastasized, resulting in poor patient outcomes. As a result, 7% of cancer patients suffer from debilitating fear of cancer recurrence. Early and accurate diagnosing of residual cancer cells will improve the outcome for the 20% of cancer patients who experience recurrence.  Additionally, it will help the 7% of cancer patients who suffer from debilitating fear of cancer recurrence. Overall, the costs of treating cancer will be lowered by diagnosing cancer earlier.<br/>	<br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a highly accurate diagnostic test for residual cancer from a blood draw. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from cancer cells circulates through the blood stream. This cancer can be detected because of mutations in the DNA of cancer cells. However, cancer DNA is rare compared to normal DNA, which makes diagnosing cancer from a blood draw difficult. Proof-of-concept data has shown that accuracy can be greatly improved through the enrichment of cancer DNA from a sample. After the sample is collected, the DNA goes through rounds of duplication, except a blocker is added to prevent normal DNA from duplicating. Through this process the cancer DNA becomes a larger percentage of the overall DNA in the sample and can be more accurately detected. This project will develop a collection of tests for accurately diagnosing residual colorectal cancer. The key tasks of this project are: 1) demonstrate the clinical robustness of the optimized test method, 2) develop additional tests to cover most colorectal cancers, and 3) demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods.

From medical implants to food packaging to green energy producing windmills, synthetic polymers offer enabling solutions to many of the world’s most demanding technical challenges. However, these materials are largely indestructible and are accumulating in the environment at an alarming rate. This research aims to develop an economically tractable approach to recycling polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, which together constitute more than 60% of all plastics produced worldwide. Unlike aluminum and glass, few commercial plastics are recycled after use, representing a tragic waste of resources. One strategy for recycling is to blend these plastics together at elevated temperature followed by reformulation into useful products. Unfortunately, this results in brittle and mechanically inferior materials due to the inability of chemically different polymers to mix at a molecular level, leading to phase separation. Poor interfacial adhesion promotes cracks and bulk failure during mechanical deformation. This project will explore the synthesis of commercially viable block copolymers that can migrate to the interface when mixed with phase separated polymers, thereby stitching the plastic domains together and recovering the superior mechanical properties associated with the virgin materials. This research effort will result in the training of Ph.D. and undergraduate students, along with postdocs, in the field of polymer science and engineering, one of the largest segments of the chemical and materials industries in the United States. Interactions of the participants with the local community will inspire students, and their families, to embrace science and engineering for higher education and prospective careers.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The crisis of plastic waste requires the development of new strategies for returning polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (iPP) and polystyrene (PS), representing more than 60% of all synthetic polymers, to product feed streams after use. One approach to recycling involves melt blending these plastics together, followed by formulation into useful items of commerce. This program will explore the synthesis of triblock and multiblock copolymers that localize at the phase separated domain interface, resulting in topological constraints and cocrystallization, which together create interfacial strength leading to mechanical properties competitive with the pure homopolymers. Butadiene and styrene will be polymerized anionically, and the polybutadiene blocks catalytically hydrogenated, yielding PE-PX, PS-PX, and PS-PE diblock, triblock and multiblock copolymers, where PX is a random copolymer containing approximately 90% ethylethylene and 10% ethylene repeat units. PX is melt miscible with iPP. Micelle formation and interfacial activity of these block copolymers with the respective pairs of homopolymers will be explored using small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS), and atomic force and transmission electron microscopy (AFM and TEM). Blends will be formulated by melt mixing and evaluated in the solid state by tensile and impact testing. Interfacial adhesion will be quantified using peel tests. The overall goals of this program are to establish the dependence of blend ductility on: block copolymer molecular weight, composition, and architecture; block copolymer concentration; and processing conditions. This sustainability effort aims to create an economically viable approach to recycling the most prevalent commodity plastics.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By beating rhythmically, flagella and cilia move fluid in the local environment of cells. This biological function enables pulmonary mucus clearance in airways and the transport of ovums from the ovary to the uterus for example. Malfunction of flagella and cilia can lead to a group of serious human disorders, ciliopathies, which cause a heavy economic and disease burden on society. However, despite the ubiquity and importance of flagella and cilia, fundamental biomechanics underlying the fluid transport of beating flagella and cilia are still poorly understood. Particularly, the detailed flow field induced by beating flagella and cilia remains unresolved. Combining state-of-the-art microscopy techniques with data-driven machine learning, the research team aims to address this difficult biomechanical problem. This research will investigate the flow field of healthy flagella as well as those of mutant flagella associated with ciliopathies using synergistic experimental and numerical modeling efforts. A potential solution to remedy the flow deficiency of malfunction flagella will be researched. In addition to the training and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, the project will produce appealing scientific videos and demonstrations to enhance the undergraduate curriculum and enrich outreach activities at the local communities of the two principal investigators.  <br/><br/>As a generic model for the morphology and dynamics of flagella and cilia, green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, will be studied in this research program. Optical microscopy will be used to track the three-dimensional (3D) fluid flow around the beating flagella of a single alga at micron scales with sub-millisecond temporal resolutions. Both wild-type and mutant algae of different swimming modes will be investigated. The mechanical efficiency of flagellar dynamics will be analyzed based on the 3D flow field. Moreover, using the experimental flow field as a basis of reference and taking advantage of modern machine-learning algorithms, the team plans to develop a numerical model of maximal simplicity that can quantitatively capture the algal flow. The model will facilitate the study of the optimization and synchronization of flagellar dynamics and the collective dynamics of algal suspensions. Through the collaborative experimental and modeling efforts, the missing link between the flagellar dynamics and the resulting microscopic fluid flow will be revealed by this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, hydrology models are used for the prediction of streamflow in the river basin and for understanding water cycles, predicting floods and droughts, and making operational decisions such as reservoir release. The models of these physical systems often depend on a number of parameters (characteristics) that describe the system. In the streamflow example, for instance, the important characteristics include slope, land cover, and soil type. However, for a wide variety of reasons, these parameters are often not known or poorly approximated.  Inverse modeling is a type of scientific method that involves working backward from observations of a physical system to estimate the parameters and identify the underlying processes or mechanisms that could have produced the observed behavior. Existing approaches for inverse modeling used in the physical science community often take too much time to compute and are unable to effectively leverage increasing amounts of data becoming available at continental and global scales. The goal of this project is to develop a new generation of machine learning algorithms for inverse modeling in environmental science applications that can leverage large datasets to provide improved prediction and uncertainty estimation at decision-relevant scales while significantly reducing the amount of computation required.  These methods will have wide applicability in disciplines as diverse as health, environment, agriculture, and engineering, and thus have the potential to address major societal challenges.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop an embedding-based machine learning framework for inverse modeling that is applicable to a wide range of scientific problems where the goal is to identify explicit or implicit characteristics of a system given its drivers and response data.

Method advancements will be made to the family of neural process methods so that they can model physical systems involving multiple interacting processes with multiple inputs and outputs. These neural process models will also incorporate scientific knowledge, such as conservation laws, as well as knowledge implicit in process-based models to generalize to out-of-sample scenarios.

During the last decade, new experiments have enabled the study of regimes of physics, in which many particles conspire to behave collectively in ways that are very different from the behaviors exhibited by individual atoms. This has allowed physicists to explore a wide range of intriguing phenomena, from synthesizing exotic new kinds of particles, to realizing states of matter that can remember their initial state for an arbitrarily long time (in sharp contrast to the predictions of the laws of thermodynamics).<br/><br/>These new experimental capabilities have renewed efforts to understand what kinds of collective behaviors can emerge in quantum many-body systems. Understanding these possibilities has both fundamental implications for expanding our understanding of the world around us, and the potential for practical implications in advancing quantum computing. One part of this project focuses on exploring a new class of such behaviors, that can arise when the microscopic particles undergo motion that is restricted in some way, with the aim of developing new mathematical tools and frameworks to describe them. Such frameworks will enable a more general exploration of what new kinds of physical effects these mobility restrictions can lead to, including their potential for storing quantum information in protected quantum states that are spatially localized near their boundaries. A major challenge in pushing the frontiers of this new generation of experiments is noise: random processes that couple a quantum system to its environment, ultimately destroying the delicate quantum information stored therein. As such, understanding noise in complex, many-body quantum systems has become an increasingly important problem. The second part of this project focuses on understanding how restrictions on particle mobility, as well as related constraints that can be imposed on quantum systems, affect the impact of certain types of noise. The goal of this study is to understand whether, and when, such constraints can lead to quantum phenomena that are unexpectedly robust to noise.<br/><br/>This award will also support the PI's education and outreach activities, which consist of (i) modernizing the undergraduate quantum mechanics curriculum and transitioning a special topics course on quantum computation and quantum information designed by the PI to a regular course, (ii) training graduate students in both basic analytical and numerical skills, and (iii) helping coordinate events aimed at attracting women and minorities to the physics major.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research with a general goal to understand how constraints in many-particle quantum systems can lead to novel phases of matter and physical phenomena. Two classes of problems will be investigated. The first consists of understanding the interplay between topology and highly constraining symmetries, such as subsystem symmetry, which requires particle motion to conserve all multipole moments. The PI will (i) explore how anomalies in subsystem symmetries can be used to understand different classes of gapless boundary modes that are known in the literature, and (ii) apply new mathematical tools to study a general construction, known as a topological defect network, that can produce a wide array of subsystem-symmetric models in 2 dimensions. This research may also have implications for understanding phases with less stringent symmetry constraints, such as conserved dipole (but not higher multipole) moments, that may lead to experimentally verifiable predictions, as global dipole symmetry arises naturally, for example, in some cold atomic systems. The second class of questions to be explored is how constraints impact the dynamics of open quantum systems. A particular focus is on understanding when slow dynamics can arise, such that quantum coherence can be preserved for an unexpectedly long time. Here, the PI will explore the impact of constraints on dynamics by developing a modified Lindblad formalism for Hilbert spaces with local constraints. This formalism can be used to study open system dynamics in a variety of cases where constraints are known to lead to atypical Hamiltonian dynamics, such as Hilbert space shattering and approximate quantum scars.<br/><br/>This award will also support the PI's education and outreach activities, which consist of (i) modernizing the undergraduate quantum mechanics curriculum and transitioning a special topics course on quantum computation and quantum information designed by the PI to a regular course, (ii) training graduate students in both basic analytical and numerical skills, and (iii) helping coordinate events aimed at attracting women and minorities to the physics major.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students will attend Bemidji State University, a regional University in northern Minnesota located within 50 miles of three indigenous nations. Over its six-year duration, 55 unique students pursuing Bachelor of Science degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, environmental sciences, or mathematics will receive up to five years of scholarship support. In addition to financial support, students will participate in a pre-orientation summer bridge week, social emotional learning workshops, STEM-specific living-learning communities, peer and faculty mentorship, tutoring, and research opportunities. These efforts are expected to create a supportive community environment that cultivates a sense of belonging. STEM faculty will also build skills in culturally responsive pedagogy and student mentorship. Effective practices and innovations can be carried forward to future cohorts of students both within and outside of STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The aims are to recruit and retain two cohorts of diverse S-STEM scholars, graduate 80% of these scholars within four years, and have at least 90% obtain jobs within six months of graduation. College students from low-income backgrounds experience adverse childhood experiences at higher rates than their economically advantaged peers. To address this issue, a Resilience-focused Systemic Paradigm centered on Social Emotional Learning (SEL) will serve as the framework for this project. Knowledge will be generated regarding how the components of the Resilience-Focused Systemic Paradigm (SEL, school environment, community environment, family environment, classroom environment, curriculum and instruction quality, and biopsychosocial function) contribute to student’s academic persistence and the sense of belonging in STEM. This project will be evaluated with a mixed-method approach using data obtained through surveys, focus groups, and interviews, and academic persistence data of the Scholars. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, professional conferences, and regional news outlets. This project is funded by NSF’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

A type not only specifies the semantics and characteristics of data elements, but also constrains the program operations and behaviors against data elements. Such type information is valuable for program analysis, and type analysis does not require complicated data-flow analysis. However, the type system in the widely used system programming languages (C/C++) has two fundamental problems. First, general types are prevalent; they obscure the specific data types and result in imprecise type-based analysis results. Second, type errors and typecasting are common; directly using erroneous types for defense mechanisms would lead to runtime errors which are considered unacceptable. This project aims to address the problems and use types for various security applications. The research results will be integrated into education to improve students' awareness of type errors, and help them capture type errors and harden their code.<br/><br/>This project aims to address fundamental problems with types in type-unsafe programming languages like C/C++ and then use the improved types for various security applications.

It will employ selective, path-based, and function-grained typecasting analysis to improve scalability and precision. The second research thrust will then develop new techniques that leverage<br/>regulated types to significantly improve the precision of several foundational analysis techniques for security. With the regulated types and precise analysis techniques, the last research thrust will build effective and practical defense mechanisms such as type-based data-/control-flow integrity.

Daniel Frisbie of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and his students will explore the mechanisms of electrical conduction in molecular organic semiconductors.  Much is still not understood about how organic semiconductors conduct electricity, and this stifles efforts to synthesize new semiconducting materials with enhanced performance.  The research plan leverages a discovery – the intramolecular conductance isotope effect – made under Professor Frisbie’s prior NSF support, which offers exciting opportunities to understand polaron transport mechanisms in much the same way the kinetic isotope effect is used in physical organic chemistry to understand the mechanisms of chemical reactions.  The project involves organic synthesis, structure characterization, conductance measurements and theoretical modeling.  The objective is to understand how the chemical structure of organic semiconductors influences and modulates their electrical conductance.  These materials are already commercialized in electronic devices such as organic light emitting devices (OLED TVs) and mobile phone displays.  In carrying out the research plan, graduate students working on the project will acquire the skills needed to enter the workforce in the semiconductor industry, for example.  Undergraduate students will be offered summer research experience. <br/><br/>The particular technical focus of this project is on understanding the nature of polarons, the de facto charge carriers in molecular semiconductors, including their size or delocalization length along pi-conjugated chains, their thermally activated motion, their hopping transition states, and the sensitivity of all these factors to molecular structure. The experimental approach focuses on the synthesis of pi-conjugated molecular wires up to 10 nm in length from gold surfaces.  The key innovation to the overall synthesis strategy will be the introduction of 13C and 15N isotopic labels to selected subunits of the wires.  The conductance of wires of length greater than 4-5 nm, where the charge transport mechanism is thermally-activated polaron-hopping, will then be measured using an established approach for making a second electrical contact to produce metal-molecule-metal junctions. An overall objective of the experimental design is to combine conductance measurements on molecular length scales with precise monomer-by-monomer control of molecular structure – augmented by selective isotopic labeling – to relate conductance to structure. A second objective is to better understand the conductance isotope effect phenomenon itself;  namely, its reproducibility and generality across different molecular wire architectures.  The experimental work will be enhanced by collaborations with quantum chemists whose calculations will both guide experimental design and aid in the interpretation of results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These organic pollutants can adversely affect both human and ecosystem health. Understanding how quickly sunlight reacts to degrade synthetic organic pollutants in aquatic systems is important for predicting and managing their health risks. However, laboratory experiments using simulated sunlight cannot be directly translated to environmental conditions and greatly overestimate how quickly sunlight reacts with synthetic organic chemicals in surface water systems including lakes and rivers. As a result, these chemicals may have longer lifetimes in surface waters than currently predicted. The overarching goal of this project is to advance the fundamental understanding of sunlight-induced photochemical degradations of synthetic organic pollutants in surface water systems. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigators (PIs) will study approximately 50 pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals in the laboratory and outdoors and will use this information to make accurate predictions about sunlight-driven degradation reactions in rivers and lakes. The successful completion of this research will benefit society through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge about the extents and rates of sunlight-driven photochemical reactions of synthetic organic pollutants in aquatic systems.  This new data and knowledge will be critical for evaluating the fate and lifetime of potentially toxic organic chemicals in lakes and rivers. Additional benefits will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and two undergraduate students at the University of St. Thomas, a predominantly undergraduate institution.<br/><br/>Sunlight-mediated photodegradation is among the most important abiotic transformation processes in aquatic systems for synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals. A major goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that laboratory-scale experiments overpredict the photolysis rates of SOCs in lakes and rivers by many orders of magnitude due to discrepancies between laboratory light sources and environmental conditions. To test this hypothesis, the Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to evaluate the direct photolysis of approximately 50 pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals in relevant aquatic systems with the goal of developing a first principles kinetic model to relate laboratory direct photolysis rates to a variety of environmental conditions. The model will be validated using outdoor mid-scale experiments that quantify the impacts of diurnal variability, water depth, cloud cover, and seasonality on the rates of direct photolysis of SOCs in aquatic systems. Finally, the PIs propose to couple laboratory and outdoor experiments, and modeling to investigate the indirect photolysis rates of selected SOCs in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM), a natural photosensitizer in surface water systems that absorbs light to generate photochemically produced reactive intermediates such as hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen species. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact by linking laboratory-measured rates with expected photodegradation rates in lakes/rivers for a wide range of SOCs. To implement the educational and training goals of this project, the PIs propose to leverage existing programs at the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison and the University of St. Thomas to recruit and mentor undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, to work on this project. In addition, the PIs plans to 1) integrate the research findings into existing undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the UW-Madison and 2) develop a website that will include a database containing all the validated results of the project. These results will be disseminated to water resource managers, relevant stakeholders, and the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They provide information about diet and environment, behavior, and evolutionary relationships. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project uses new and emerging techniques to better understand the relationships among tooth shape, function, and diet as teeth change across the course of primate maturation. Because many analytical methods require teeth with little wear, many fossil teeth are excluded from study due to levels of wear. This project leverages data across all stages of tooth wear and characterizes the diets of individual primate species represented in the fossil record, providing a more comprehensive framework of ecological context, diversity, and adaptive significance to be built for the study of early ape communities. In addition, this project provides research opportunities for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM. The investigator also hosts community outreach and engagement events through the local natural history museum and a nonprofit science and social studies program.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve resolution of Early Miocene primate dietary behaviors by combining updated methods of whole-crown dental topographic analysis with cutting-edge surface shape segmentation into a new approach for characterizing and differentiating (macroscopic) tooth wear among primates with different dietary behaviors. Importantly, specimens across the spectrum of wear stages are used to inform reconstructions of dietary behaviors and variation. The research is motivated by three specific questions: 1) How do differences in tooth crown wear correlate with different diets in extant primates? 2) Does wear on individual cusps reflect different degrees of resolution for dietary differentiation in extant primates? and 3) What do patterns of wear in Early Miocene catarrhines indicate regarding their dietary breadth? To address these questions, a sample of extant and fossil specimens are characterized using variables from dental topographic analysis: ariaDNE, 3D-OPCR, and RFI. Advances in surface segmentation techniques enable these aggregate variables to be efficiently assessed not only on whole crowns, as is typical, but also on individual cusps. This novel approach and its application across stages of tooth wear can greatly improve resolution of how tooth function varies over time and across the crown surface. Moreover, the individuation of cusps can provide important insights regarding the distribution of dietary signal across the tooth crown surface, with implications for assessing dental function and evolution in hominins, other primates, and other mammals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of data regarding force used by police presents a number of statistical challenges that can, if not addressed carefully, lead to an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the issues. This can in turn hamper or improperly redirect reform efforts, damage the credibility of advocacy campaigns, and alienate the communities most directly impacted by the use of force by police. This forum is part of a larger series of workshops hosted by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) in a forum series titled “Statistics Serving Society.” This series seeks to address urgent issues of statistical importance in society. Past forum topics have included algorithmic fairness, unplanned disruptions to clinical trials during COVID-19, and privacy-preserving methodologies. The Fall 2023 forum will result in collaborative research that is aimed at improving evidence-based policy on policing in urban and rural areas. Practitioners and community partners will further motivate the work being conducted and the resulting output of the forum. Engagement of both undergraduate and graduate students will be incorporated into the forum.<br/><br/>This in-person forum will highlight the unique approaches and perspectives developed by scholars working in this area, in order to build a deeper understanding of the issues and to improve the quality of evidence used to inform reform efforts. The range of obstacles and data limitations present in police use of force data make it a particularly challenging area to study, with issues including data quality and completeness, processing of unstructured data, privacy concerns, and statistical challenges in analyzing fairness. These issues are present in the study of other important social phenomena, and the knowledge gained through this exchange can improve research on related urgent social issues. This forum will also foster interdisciplinary collaboration between its proposed audience of statisticians, community members, activists, social scientists, policymakers, and law enforcement professionals.

While some progress has been made in the past decade, it is clear that URMs tend to encounter social and personal obstacles that their well-represented counterparts do not face as they navigate the road from undergraduate training to workforce participation and career development. We believe that key mentoring strategies at the graduate school level, along with targeted introductions to research and mentoring opportunities for undergraduates, will help increase both the quantity of URMs entering the engineering workforce and the quality of experiences URMs need to thrive in high-level engineering careers. In particular, we aim for “best practices” mentoring that enables URM engineering graduate students to better understand and envision 1) research-based engineering careers; 2) transdisciplinary, team-based approaches needed to solve complex problems; and 3) ways to translate solutions into the market through technology transfer. Having such an understanding and vision, typically achieved by effective mentorship, is crucial for developing the leadership, communications, and professional competencies that future technology leaders in industry, academia, and government need from graduate education. To accomplish our goals, we propose Mentoring for the Formation of Research Careers in Engineering, or M-FORCE. This innovative, inclusive, open-access mentoring hub is designed to meet the goals of Track 3 of NSF’s Broadening Participation in Engineering program (NSF 22-514). <br/><br/>M-FORCE, which is a partnership between the University of Minnesota, Morgan State University, and the National GEM Consortium, will create belonging and inclusion for URM engineering graduate students that will enhance knowledge of the research enterprise and its career pathways. It will also provide a model for a collaborative community that can be adapted to any graduate program. Data collected through the M-FORCE hub will advance understanding of 1) the role that collective and individual mentoring can play in improving URM graduate school training and career development experiences; 2) how mentoring and network formation impacts graduate students’ perception of belonging and inclusion, which strongly influences their consideration of a research career in engineering; 3) how early exposure to research career concepts impact URM graduate student motivation to pursue and complete terminal degrees; and 4) how exposure to research and graduate school preparation activities influences URM undergraduates’ interest in and decisions about research careers in engineering. M-FORCE will leverage the best practices of minority serving institutions like HBCUs, which have been exceptional at providing community and a sense of belonging to URM engineering undergraduate and graduate students. It will also leverage best practices of very high-research R1 (and predominately white) universities that have been transitioning research from siloed to convergent approaches that are needed to solve today’s complex problems. Finally, M-FORCE will give URM undergraduates exposure to research and formal graduate school preparation and the rare opportunity to meet a critical mass of URM graduate students performing research and preparing to become leaders in technology fields. After five years, our hub model will be customizable for any campus research community to support and prepare URM engineering graduate students, especially first-generation college students. It will also provide a model of fairness and equity in institutional and program structures that can supplement formal academic training for engineering graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will design and test materials and electrochemical reaction conditions that selectively promote hydrogen generation while avoiding the production of undesirable chloride-containing byproducts. The scientific outcomes will aid the development of improved energy storage and chemical manufacturing strategies that reduce our nation’s reliance on non-renewable resources. Furthermore, the research will be integrated with educational and outreach initiatives emphasizing participation by underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The project focuses on selective electrocatalytic water oxidation in systems containing chlorine salts. By manipulating the electronic structure of an oxide catalyst, the active sites for water and chlorine-oxidation processes will be decoupled when the pH-dependent activation of oxygen redox is triggered in highly covalent materials. This sidesteps the coupling between binding strengths of chlorine- and oxygen-containing intermediates at transition metal sites, hindering independent optimization of the reaction pathways. In situ and operando spectroscopic approaches (X-ray, vibrational) will identify adsorbed species, their dependence on applied potential and electrolyte composition, and their interaction with co-adsorbates. Comparison of adsorbate affinity with theoretical calculations will establish a tradeoff in desired reaction pathway as a function of surface energetics. Furthermore, the study will generate mechanistic understanding of the role a secondary manganese-oxide based coating atop an electrocatalyst can play in limiting the transport of chloride ions and manipulating adsorbate binding at the buried interface.

This project investigates potential benefits of a four-day workweek for employees, organizations, and the environment. The study investigates how a four-day workweek shapes workers’ mental and physical health, levels of satisfaction, and behavior, including household carbon use. Reducing household carbon use is one potential strategy to mitigate human effects on the changing climate. The research also considers how a four-day workweek might benefit companies by investigating company revenue, employee absenteeism, and worker turnover. The four-day week may be an important contributor to national well-being and prosperity.<br/><br/>The project is the first known major scientific investigation of a four-day workweek with a robust research design. Investigators partner with 4 Day Week Global, a non-profit that organizes six-month trials for institutions to adopt a four-day workweek. Researchers use a matched pair case-control design with 20 U.S. companies who trial the four-day workweek, plus 20 control companies. The project combines surveys, interviews, and administrative data. The surveys take place across four waves: trial baseline, mid-point, trial end, and six months from trial end, with a survey population of between 1000 and 2000. Interviews are conducted twice each with 40 employees or managers and 10 CEOs. The study investigates how a four-day workweek shapes workers’ stress and burnout, mental and physical health, exercise, sleep, life and time-use satisfaction, work-life conflict, and household carbon use. An intersectional approach enables the study of potentially disparate effects of the four-day week on workers by class, life stage, and demographic characteristics. The cross-company mixed-methods design permits comparative analysis across firms, occupations, and industries, thereby contributing to understanding of workplace flexibility and organizational change. Investigating how workplace policies shape carbon emissions may also illuminate how paid work could help to mitigate climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Empowering neurodivergent participation in engineering by understanding both the strengths and challenges faced will significantly benefit the generation of creative and innovative solutions needed to solve complex global and societal problems. This National Science Foundation’s Broadening Participation in Engineering collaborative project at Utah State University and Minnesota State University will approach neurodiversity in engineering by engaging with the neurodivergent community on social media (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) to understand their strengths and challenges. Social media is a vast information source where communities share their lived experiences and build community, and more specifically, the neurodivergent presence online expanded after the COVID-19 quarantine. Neurodivergent people share their lived experiences and interact with one another to generate shared meaning resulting in new emancipatory language that describe their experiences and emancipate themselves from deficit-based framing and stereotypes. Such language embraces both strengths and challenges faced by neurodivergent people which can be leveraged in engineering education to support neurodivergent students. By engaging with neurodivergent communities, trust can be built between researchers and neurodivergent people to work together to develop better learning accommodations and resources. Further, this language can be informative to higher education, for example, to write policy and develop learning accommodations that represent and potentially increase participation and degree completion of neurodivergent students. In engineering, neurodivergent students will share their stories in engineering to share their lived experiences such as successes and offer coping mechanisms to manage challenges. These stories will be shared publicly to encourage other neurodivergent students in their studies and inform peers and faculty about neurodivergence in engineering. <br/><br/>This mixed-methods, collaborative project will identify emancipatory language that describe the strengths and challenges of neurodivergent students in engineering (neurodivergent refers to people who think, function, and behave significantly different from societal “norms,” e.g., ADHD, autism, schizophrenia). This project will first implement social media analytics to engage with and identify emancipatory language in the public neurodivergent community. Social media platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, Twitter) will be scraped for neurodivergent related content and analyzed using natural language processing techniques (latent Dirichlet allocation and sentiment analysis). This method will reveal common language associated with neurodivergent strengths and challenges. Findings will then be used to develop a strengths and challenges interview protocol for the next phase. The next phase will consist of two narrative inquiries. The first inquiry will be longitudinal where 24 neurodivergent engineering students at Utah State University will be interviewed over a semester to develop semester long narratives. The second inquiry will leverage social media to recruit neurodivergent engineering students across the nation to develop a variety of narratives. Expected outcomes will include building trust between neurodivergent and research communities, developing a lexicon of words to describe and conceptualize neurodivergence in engineering, demonstrating social media analytics and natural language processing methods in engineering education research, and developing a resource and narrative depository for neurodivergent engineering students and engineering faculty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zhdankin of the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) is studying the development of new reagents and synthetic methodologies based on the organic chemistry of iodine. The project is exploring the preparation and fundamental chemistry of new hypervalent iodine compounds.  The ability of hypervalent iodine species to modify organic compounds when coupled with their efficiency and sustainability makes them useful among academic and industrial scientists. This utility is the result of iodine behaving much like a transition metal in many applications. The continued exploration and utilization of these similarities is leading to the development of new useful methodologies for modern organic chemistry. More broadly speaking, this project is at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry and is well-suited for undergraduate, graduate, and more advanced researchers including researchers in industry. The project is expected to provide high level of education and training for students, many of whom are underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>A broad study of new, metal-free, iodine-mediated reactions and an exploratory search for new and potentially useful hypervalent reagents is proposed. Specific objectives include: (i) the development of pseudocyclic arylbenziodoxaboroles as benzyne precursors and highly efficient electrophilic arylating reagents under neutral, aqueous conditions, (ii) the exploration of 4-iodonium substituted arylboronic acids as para-benzyne precursors, (iii) the study of the synthesis and reactivity of stabilized iodonium derivatives of porphyrins and dipyrromethenes, and (iv) the search for new types of polyvalent iodine compounds that are stabilized by internal halogen bonding. New synthetic methodologies based on these efforts will contribute to the discovery of environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as they utilize non-toxic iodine compounds in water as catalysts or as recoverable/recyclable reagents. The successful development of this methodology will have an impact on the areas of science where the synthesis of organic molecules is required, such as in academia and in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most patients initially show some responsiveness to chemotherapy, 20-30% of ovarian cancer patients experience recurrence within 6 months of the completion of treatment. Currently, there is no method to predict a patient’s response to chemotherapy prior to initiating treatment. There is a rare subpopulation of cancer cells that can transition into a temporary dormant state in response to harsh external cues, allowing them to evade chemotherapy. These cells can then reawaken after treatment has concluded and develop into metastatic disease. The main goals of this project are to utilize a novel silica-based material to investigate the signaling mechanisms directing cells to enter dormancy, and then use this knowledge to develop a clinical tool to identify patients at increased risk for chemoresistance. The results from this project could be used to inform the development of more effective therapeutics to target dormant cancer cells. Beyond scientific exploration, this project also aims to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in engineering by promoting engagement with underrepresented K-12 students in the Twin Cities area. This outreach will include educational presentations and hands-on experiences on various engineering topics, including cancer bioengineering. A new, hands-on cell encapsulation activity will also be developed and integrated into an existing Introduction to Tissue Engineering outreach module offered multiple times each summer through the UMN College of Science and Engineering. <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to leverage a novel platform to determine the role of interferon signaling on the induction of, sustenance of, and awakening from cellular dormancy. Dormancy-capable cancer cells can exist in a temporary, non-proliferative state, allowing them to evade many common chemotherapeutics. Interferons are potent signaling molecules with known antiviral and immunomodulatory functions. Recently, elevated interferon signaling in cancer cells has been hypothesized to contribute to increased chemoresistance. Dormancy-capable cancer cells also show evidence of significant interferon signaling activation. The first objective of this project is to utilize a novel encapsulation platform to identify the precise interferon-stimulated signaling axes promoting dormancy. Genetic knockdowns will be used to evaluate the contribution to dormancy induction and chemoresistance of specific interferon-stimulated transcriptional regulators. The second objective of this project is to develop a prognostic tool that could be used to predict a patient’s response to chemotherapy. Previous work has shown that immobilization in silica gel selects for a chemoresistant subpopulation of cancer cells. A retrospective study of ovarian cancer patients will be performed to assess the prognostic potential of silica gel immobilization as a method for identifying patients at risk of chemoresistance. In parallel, results from the mechanistic investigation will be leveraged, in conjunction with machine learning techniques, to generate an interferon-related prognostic gene signature from single cell sequencing data of patient tumors. These results will advance the understanding of cancer cell dormancy and develop new strategies for stratifying ovarian cancer patients to inform treatment decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nearly 100 such systems have been observed to date. Advanced GW detectors are expected to further improve their sensitivities, and to conduct extended observing runs in the next 3-5 years. One of the primary targets of these upcoming runs is the detection of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) that arises by summing up GWs from all merging BBH, BNS, and BHNS systems in the universe. This project will promote the study of the SGWB into a new probe of the formation of structure in the universe. It will do so by correlating the SGWB measurements with electromagnetic (EM) observations, such as observations of the galaxy distribution on the sky or gravitational weak lensing. The project will enable strong participation of both undergraduate and graduate students in high-visibility studies in this emerging field, and it will promote participation of women and underrepresented minorities through a series of research and outreach activities and initiatives at the University of Minnesota and more broadly.  <br/><br/>The project will develop two formalisms to measure correlations of SGWB anisotropy with EM tracers of the large scale structure in the universe. One formalism will build on the existing cross-correlation techniques to measure anisotropy in the GW energy density. The other will leverage existing parameter estimation pipelines for compact binary mergers, hence dramatically (~1000x) increasing the sensitivity to the SGWB due to such mergers. The two formalisms will be applied to the data acquired in the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. They will also take advantage of the upcoming Euclid survey that will revolutionize the understanding of the galaxy distribution on the largest scales. Combining these premier data sets, of both GW and EM flavors, with the state-of-the-art analysis pipelines will result in orders-of-magnitude more sensitive SGWB-EM correlation measurements, with a potential to detect such correlations for the first time and start constraining astrophysical and cosmological models. The project will bring together GW astrophysicists and traditional astronomers, and will serve to strengthen the connections between the two communities. Students participating in the project will have unique opportunities to closely work with experts in both GW and traditional astronomy communities, and to play leading roles in defining the emerging new astrophysics and cosmology probes. The project will also bring together experts across the world, specifically from Europe, India, and the United States, hence strengthening the ties across the international scientific community. As the team includes 50% women, a strong effort will be made to promote involvement of women in astrophysics by connecting with appropriate groups and organizations at the University of Minnesota and participating in their activities, meetings, and visits to local schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Assessing the hazard associated with a fault zone requires understanding the conditions that promote earthquake nucleation. Shearing on faults can occur in an unstable manner, where rapid slip allows an earthquake to nucleate, or in a stable manner, where slip is steady and suppresses earthquake nucleation. Although much work has been devoted to understanding the conditions that lead to earthquake nucleation in the relatively cold portions of Earth’s crust, there is still a considerable gap in knowledge regarding the stability of faults in hotter regions. These hotter regions include the conduits of explosive volcanoes and transform faults in the oceans. This project will determine the influence of temperature on fault stability to enable accurate assessments of hazard and risk in these regions. This work will also provide training to early-career researchers at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. The team involved in this research will present on high-temperature experimental rock physics via international conferences, and they will run a short-course on earthquakes and faulting to be offered to early-career researchers around the world in an in-person and virtual format.<br/><br/>The project team will answer three questions related to fault stability at high temperatures. First, how do extreme temperatures affect the strength and stability of fault materials? To answer this question, deformation experiments will be conducted on fault materials over a wide range of conditions. Second, what microscopic mechanisms control the strength of fault materials, and how do they compete with one another? To answer this question, the team will use high-resolution microscopy to compare mechanical measurements with theoretical models based on the microphysics of rock deformation. Third, how do these mechanisms interact to determine fault stability, and what does this mean for the depth range of earthquakes in natural settings? To answer this question, the project team will assess the relationships among microscopic features, the macroscopic strength, the observed stability, and the rate of deformation. The net result of these observations will be a refined model for the stability of fault zones at high temperatures, which can then be compared to available catalogs of earthquake locations in relatively “hot” regions to test predictions of the depth range of earthquake nucleation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this unique phase, electron spins in a material do not establish ordered patterns, even at zero temperature, as they normally do in conventional magnets, but remain liquid-like due to the peculiarities of quantum mechanics. This phase has been a central theme in condensed matter physics for decades, both from a fundamental perspective and in terms of its potential applications in novel technologies, such as their promise for building robust quantum computers. It is known that the properties of the spin liquid phase in real materials can be modified or destroyed in the presence of disorder, such as atomic imperfections due to missing atoms or impurities. In this project, the PI and her team will investigate how different types of disorder in real materials can suppress or enhance the discernibility of quantum spin liquid phase and the unique quantum mechanical properties associated with this phase. This theoretical research will be conducted in close collaboration with experimental studies.<br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities that are linked to the research projects. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in condensed matter physics with a particular eye toward broadening participation of underrepresented groups in the research projects.

This broad field has recently experienced significant advances in both theory and experiment. In particular, the quantum spin liquid phase has been one of the central themes in condensed matter physics, owing to their remarkable emergent properties, including long-range entanglement, topological degeneracy and fractionalized excitations. A growing number of candidate magnetic materials are believed to be adequately described by quantum spin liquid models. Some level of disorder is inevitable in real quantum spin liquid candidate materials, which makes it necessary to understand the competition between quantum fluctuations and randomness in order to unveil the true nature of their low-energy phase. One of the main goals of this project is to expand the current understanding of the effects of disorder in quantum magnets. The PI will study how quantum spin liquids respond to various forms of disorder, such as dislocations, vacancies, impurities, and bond randomness.

Microgrids are local electric energy systems that can operate with the grid and separate from the grid during emergencies. Microgrids can improve grid resiliency and sustainability, and accelerate disaster recovery. The project will bring transformative change to how microgrids are designed and operated by addressing the gap between theoretical studies and real-world applications. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art data-driven and machine learning algorithms will be employed. The intellectual merits of the project include developing a new approach to accurately model real-world conditions, using machine learning to reduce model complexity, and creating and field-validating a microgrid stability prediction tool. The broader impacts of the project include an improved method to design and operate microgrids which would reduce implementation costs. By reducing costs, microgrids can be deployed faster in both developing and developed nations. This would quicken the electrification of historically marginalized communities and improve grid resiliency, robustness, and sustainability. The newly created knowledge would be disseminated through hands-on courses and workshops on power engineering. <br/><br/>Stability prediction for microgrids require accurate mathematical modeling of the physical system to capture important dynamics and subtleties. Current modeling practices do not account for two critical real-world phenomena, namely, controller saturation and protection action, both of which have drastic effects on system stability. The first technical contribution of this project will address this gap by developing an approach to concurrently model those two phenomena. Additionally, microgrid stability studies are approached through linear or nonlinear techniques. Stability techniques can become too complex due to model order and number of nonlinearities. The second technical contribution will leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to reduce a system’s model order by creating surrogates. The third technical contribution will be a microgrid stability prediction tool using SciML that will predict transient stability under different operating conditions and design factors. Data from an industry-grade microgrid and real-world equipment will be used to tune and confirm the accuracy of those surrogates and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these models, the objects aiming to describe reality are functions defined in regions of space-time and satisfying certain partial differential equations. The research carried out by the PI focuses on the equations arising in the context of fluid mechanics. The solutions of partial differential equations are usually described by an infinite number of parameters. This is a complication, but the reward is that the resulting models are in some sense canonical. For example, once we make a small number of very reasonable assumptions about fluid motion, we necessarily end up with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. There is essentially no ambiguity about what the model should be, and the Navier-Stokes equation is widely used in science and engineering, from airplane design, weather prediction, and climate modeling to computations of various water flows. To be able to perform computer simulations of the equations, it is necessary to reduce the continuum models to models described by finitely many parameters. However, this step is not canonical, there are many reasonable ways of doing it. When the continuum model is well-understood mathematically, its reductions to finite-dimensional models and their relations are relatively well understood. Of course, one should not overstate this - even in that case there are still many interesting open problems. However, our mathematical understanding of the Navier-Stokes equation is quite incomplete, and that makes the interpretations of the results from its finite-dimensional reductions harder. One way to think about the research in this project is that it aims to contribute to filling this gap in our knowledge and ultimately make our modeling more efficient. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, this project focuses on the following topics: (i) Well-posedness, (non)-uniqueness, backward uniqueness, and critical situations for basic equations. In recent years, important advances have been made concerning well-posedness and non-uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes and related equations, but important basic questions still remain open. For example, can the solution operator be continuously extended from smooth solutions to spaces with topologies generated by natural physical quantities such as energy? Are regularity estimates in two-dimensional domains with boundary saturated by some solutions? (ii) Steady-state solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and deformations of Serrin’s swirling vortex. The study of steady-state solutions, in addition to being of independent practical interest, provides insights for improving our understanding of time-dependent solutions. In this project, the focus is on deformations of certain known classes of solutions (due to Serrin) with symmetries to solutions with fewer symmetries. It is worth pointing out that both Serrin's solutions and the deformations envisaged here have connections to tornadoes; (iii) Liouville Theorems and related linear problems. Liouville theorems aim to describe global bounded solutions in all space-time and are closely related to open regularity questions about the equation. In this project, they are studied mostly in the steady-state setting. Their study also leads to interesting linear problems that will be addressed; (iv) One-dimensional models, including the study of possible avoidance of singularities by generic forcing for the quaternionic Burgers model and the global well-posedness and more detailed solution behavior for the De Gregorio model. There are many open problems even at the level of the one-dimensional models. These problems should provide good steppingstones towards improving our understanding and eventually applying the lessons learned from studying these models to higher dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diamond single crystals have long been prized as gemstones but have also shown great promise for new technical applications because of their unique properties. While natural diamonds are formed from carbon in the earth’s crust at depths greater than 100 miles, these conditions can be mimicked in the laboratory allowing synthetic diamond crystals of the highest quality to be manufactured using the High-Pressure, High-Temperature growth process. This grant supports fundamental research to improve this process so that single-crystal diamonds can be manufactured in larger sizes, at ultra-high quality, and for less cost, thus enabling application in optical elements for high-power X-ray systems, as well as in devices for radiation detectors in nuclear reactors and medical applications, power electronics, and quantum computing. Results from this research will favorably impact economic competitiveness, and national security. This research involves several disciplines including advanced manufacturing, computational modeling, crystal growth, and materials science. The multi-disciplinary approach helps broaden participation and positively impacts engineering education.<br/><br/>Manufacturing processes employed to grow large, single crystals must achieve atomic-level structural perfection while simultaneously maintaining yields that are high enough to meet cost objectives. This project addresses the production of single-crystal diamond via crystal growth in a High-Pressure, High-Temperature system. This system has the capability to grow diamonds of the highest crystalline quality. However, extreme pressure (5 GPa) and temperature (1,500 K) make direct, in situ diagnostics of growth impossible and modeling a vital tool for process improvement. This project develops and applies novel computational models based on thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport to better understand the fundamental mechanisms responsible for single-crystal diamond growth in the High-Pressure, High-Temperature system. These models are validated via growth experiments conducted by GOALI partner, Euclid Beamlabs, LLC, and applied to improve manufacturing outcomes, such as large crystal size and increased growth rate. An important goal is to avoid process conditions leading to inclusions, which are micron-sized defects containing metallic solvent trapped during growth. Multi-scale models describe steps of atomic height that move across the facets of the growing diamond and predict when an equidistant train of steps destabilizes to form bunches, triggering inclusion formation. Understanding the onset of bunching thus allows innovative growth strategies, such as time-dependent tilting of the system, to be assessed by modeling and tested using experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will expose multiple students to green chemical design principles and offer interdisciplinary training in fundamental environmental, synthetic, and computational chemistry as well as the biological processes and engineering concepts involved in water treatment.

The project will use a screening approach to identify fluorinated functional groups resistant to transformation. The reaction rates for abiotic and biological degradation processes will be measured and fluorinated reaction products identified.

This window would, in principle, allow extension of the spectrum of light that can be harvested and provide access for charge transfer from lower energy triplet states of the sensitizers. The triplet states that are of particular interest in this proposal are those that are generated via singlet fission.

To increase the availability of current and future vaccines, the vaccine cold chain needs to be eliminated. While sugars and bulking agents are being explored to increase the thermal stability of viral vaccines, the cold chain is still the main method to stabilize viral vaccines. This is not only an issue for developing countries; proper temperature storage of vaccines is also a challenge in the US, with an outbreak of influenza having been potentially linked to improper vaccine refrigeration. A more standard and promising method to stabilize vaccine formulations is to add stabilizing excipients. With excipients, vaccines can be stored under refrigeration conditions. However, this approach has suffered from both a lack of generalizability and the absence of a fundamental understanding of the mechanism whereby stabilization is achieved. Empirical evidence has identified several excipients such as sugars, amino acids, and bulking agents like gelatin, dextran, and cellulose that help to stabilize proteins/viruses in both wet and dry formulations. In addition, it has been demonstrated that complex combinations of excipients (mixtures) are often used in final formulations. Experimental observations suggest that many of the excipients help to structure water and/or replace hydrogen-bonding interactions with the surface of the protein/virus to provide stability. However, most of the work published in this area has been empirical and experimental in nature and would be difficult to perform at the scale needed to elucidate the subtle ways in which molecular structure affects water structure and thus stability. In this project,  a combination of experiments, modeling, and machine learning will be used to identify molecular features/motifs that impart this stability and use this framework to discover excipient mixtures for vaccine formulations. This approach has the potential to shift the paradigm for vaccine formulation – allowing for tailoring of formulations based on knowledge of the virus itself, rather than through an iterative, Edisonian process.<br/><br/>Technical Description: In this research, the team will use molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning in concert with a panel of experimental techniques to identify and understand the key molecular motifs needed for excipient molecules to create a stable virus-containing formulation. The interactions of both viruses and excipients with water is a critical design parameter for the creation of stable formulations; however, the complexity of these interactions represents a vast parameter space that is difficult to deconvolute and not suited to traditional materials design. This DMREF program will combine experimental measurements of excipient-virus interactions with a rapid computational scheme to design stabilizing formulations to enable the minimization of cold chain requirements for viral vaccines. The stability of viruses and other proteins is directly connected to interactions with water. However, the complexity of the available interactions has prevented bottom-up prediction. A materials design protocol will be developed that predicts how molecular motifs such as hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions give rise to the structuring of water and correlate with changes in virus stability. During the project, high school and community college student will be exposed to graduate level science and their interest piqued towards future careers in science and engineering. The goals of this project will be to (1) attain a comprehensive protocol for testing the potential effects of a new excipient molecule on virus stability and (2) use the resulting data to develop a machine-learning algorithm to enable the predictive design of more complex excipient formations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of these include dental plaque, the slime that forms on ship hulls, and wound-associated infections. Biofilms contain millions of microscopic cells, and the individual locations of these cells affect their ability to function. For example, the location of cells within a wound-associated biofilm affects their ability to resist antibiotics. To understand how cell location affects function, their locations must be controlled in three dimensions; however, because the microorganisms within a biofilm are microscopically small, they are difficult to manipulate at a single cell level. This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Montana State University, Bozeman, supports the investigation of biofilm structure and function by building biofilms from microscopic modules that can be assembled, disassembled, and analyzed in a controlled manner. This approach will enable researchers to synthetically construct multi-species biofilms in the laboratory to understand how bugs communicate, cooperate, or compete.

The spatial locations of microbes in a biofilm impact biofilm function and physiology; however, methods for structuring biofilms in three dimensions are currently lacking. The ability to synthetically construct a heterogeneous, multi-species biofilm by placing microorganisms in discrete locations within a cultivated environment would allow researchers to bridge this gap and explore how bugs communicate, cooperate, or compete. To achieve this, colloidal engineering techniques will be applied to place microbes in spatially organized three-dimensional locations to understand how spatial heterogeneity influences structure-function relationships in biofilms. The aims of this proposal are to create monodisperse capsules of gels and shells to encapsulate microbes, to assemble capsules into three-dimensional structures, and finally to create modular synthetic consortia of bacteria to explore questions related to heterogeneity in biofilms. These constructs will be used to understand how biofilm behavior such as quorum sensing, matrix formation, and dormancy arises from heterogeneity in biofilms.

From cell phones and medical devices to cars and traffic monitors, we rely on electronic circuits to keep us connected, healthy, and safe. While the vast majority of electronics today are built using hard, rigid materials, electronics that are soft and flexible are desirable for many applications. For example, wearable and implantable biomedical sensors will benefit from advances in flexible electronics that can bend and stretch to conform to the body. This research aims to make transformative changes in the performance, stability, and durability of flexible electronics. The proposed activities will generate a novel low-cost approach to fabricating flexible circuits. Results from this work will enable this novel fabrication approach to be used in a wide array of next-generation flexible circuit applications including displays, biomedical sensors, and durable lightweight electronics for military applications. In addition, a synergistic combination of research and integrated education activities are proposed that aim to inspire the next generation of electrical engineers and increase engagement of students in engineering.<br/><br/>Currently, flexible circuit technology is readily available for passives (metals) but in applications such as displays and sensors, flexible transistors (semiconductors) are needed. The thermal properties and solvent compatibility of plastic substrates place severe limitations on the fabrication of flexible thin-film transistors (TFTs), so TFT performance is sacrificed to achieve flexible, lightweight circuits. To overcome the fundamental tradeoff between the processing requirements of substrates and TFTs, we will leverage new advancements in photonic processing technology to produce high-performance flexible TFTs. Photonic curing uses short, intense pulses of broadband light to heat a thin film, while most of the substrate remains near room temperature. However, there is a compelling need to better understand the physics of the photonic curing process and the quality of photonically cured semiconductor TFTs. This research will pursue the following four objectives: (1) Predict the 3D thermal profile in circuits during photonic curing, and understand how geometry, device layout, proximity effects, and material properties impact curing temperature; (2) Determine the impact of photonic curing on trap states and electron transport in oxide semiconductors on plastic substrates by combining electrical and materials characterizations with a model of the density of electronic traps in the semiconductor; (3) Identify failure mechanisms of the plastic substrate to enable the oxide semiconductor to be more aggressively cured without damaging the substrates, and (4) Analyze multiple simultaneous stress factors in flexible oxide TFTs to improve their durability using a novel testing scheme that mimics a realistic operating environment. This research will advance science by shedding new light on the sub-millisecond interactions between light, heat, and thin-film semiconductor materials. New models that predict the thermal profiles during large-area photonic curing will enable this technology to be used in a wide array of flexible circuit applications. Furthermore, these activities will also build a firm foundation for the PI to pursue her long-term career goal of leading high-impact collaborative projects with physicians and health care providers. She aims to create innovative tools leading to a paradigm shift in how health care is delivered in fields such as emergency triage, battlefield wound monitoring, implantable neural interfaces, and soft wireless pediatric devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graphs can model complex networked systems, and as such graph-based machine learning systems aiming at inferences from structured data, have gained significant traction. Data-driven systems, on the other hand, must deal with noisy, uncertain, and outlying measurements, as well as data provided by untrustworthy or even malicious sources. In addition, graph-aware systems must cope with errors in the estimated graph structure. Aspiring to address these challenges, this project introduces a comprehensive framework for robust learning over graphs that can identify and mitigate outliers, adversarial attacks, and errors in the graph structure. The development of scalable, robust, and trustworthy learning can enable active and timely inference and decision-making in domains such as social analytics, crowdsourcing, health informatics, and Internet-of-Things security.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to fortify learning over graphs against noise, anomalies, errors in the data, and adversaries. This project consists of three intertwined thrusts: (T1) identifying anomalies in nodal processes over network graphs; (T2) Graph-aware deep learning under perturbed graph structure, and; (T3) information and decision fusion to quantify the reliability of information sources. T1 leverages random sampling and consensus, as well as graph signal processing tools to pinpoint outlying nodes. Dealing with noisy or perturbed graph topologies, T2 endows graph convolutional networks with dithering-inspired modules that are robust to changes in graph links. Finally, T3 will design and analyze graph-cognizant unsupervised ensemble learning and crowdsourcing algorithms to assess the reliability and usefulness of various information sources. Results from this project will be disseminated to the broader research community through publications, workshops, and code sharing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work makes the knowledge of first speakers of the language accessible to the community, language learners, and linguists. The project is an in-depth linguistic examination of how and when to use specific grammatical patterns depending on the situation and the speaker’s intent, which serves to further linguistic understanding of how human language functions and to document and support an endangered Indigenous language.<br/><br/>Speakers of a language can convey a proposition on its own, such as in the sentence, ""It is snowing,"" but often such ideas are embedded in other contexts, such as in ""I think it is snowing,"" or ""when it is snowing, I wear a jacket."" In each of these English examples, ""it is snowing"" looks the same, but in many other languages including the language of interest in this project, speakers use different grammatical structures to express the proposition in each context. These different grammatical structures are called ""clause types,"" and fluent speakers use them to convey a wide range of nuanced meanings. This project elucidates how these configurations are used by native speakers. This informs a theoretical linguistic understanding of clause typing generally while also supporting the needs of the community by documenting valuable linguistic data and teaching learners how the language functions. In the absence of everyday immersion environments where learners would have the rich and varied contexts necessary to acquire the nuances required for mastery of the language, linguistic analysis provides generalizations of native speaker grammar patterns for learners to emulate.

While some eruptions are explosive, others erupt without major explosive behavior, leading to different natural hazards for each eruptive style. These distinct eruption styles are controlled by the fundamental physical properties of magma, particularly viscosity, and density. The viscosity of magma is highly dependent on the atomic-scale structure of the magma, influenced by magma composition, temperature, pressure, and the presence of dissolved gasses such as water vapor. In this study, the researchers aim to obtain fundamental physical constraints on the structure and viscosity of magma at conditions relevant to the Earth’s interior. We will combine the experimentally derived physical properties of magma and fluids with numerical simulations to predict how magmas migrate from the Earth’s subducting plates. It is the migration of this material that ultimately leads to eruptions at the surface, but the complex role of viscosity in magma transport makes it difficult to trace material from its source in the interior to the surface. The project will  provide training for the next generation of Earth Scientists at various stages of their career, including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral scholars.  <br/><br/>Although extensive research has been done to constrain the elastic and transport properties of fluids and melts at conditions relevant to the Earth’s interior, the combined effects of pressure, temperature, and dissolved water remain poorly constrained at the conditions of the upper mantle where these melts are produced.

This work will quantify the structure and properties of aqueous fluids with dissolved albite, in addition to albite and basaltic melts with and without water. The results will provide insight into how pressure, temperature, and composition affect the structure and viscosity of polymerized aluminosilicate melts at mid-mantle depths and illuminate the causes of observed pressure anomalies on viscosity. The resulting viscosities will be integrated into two-phase flow models in the slab-arc system and the upwelling region above the mantle transition zone to assess the pathways of melt migrations through state-of-the-art geodynamical models. These models will assess how the pattern of fluid migration changes with slab age and subduction rate, slab thermal structure, and the distribution and volume of fluid sources in the subducting slab. The resulting work will assess the impact of fluid volumes due to melting and whether melting alone is sufficient to focus melts into a narrow region beneath volcanic regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project will explore the impact of soil carbon complexity on microbial growth and interactions between microbes competing for limited carbon resources. Soil carbon can be broadly categorized as either readily available for microbial consumption (labile carbon) or difficult for microbial populations to metabolize (recalcitrant carbon). In order to utilize recalcitrant carbon, microbes must first break these complex compounds into their building blocks while also defending these building blocks from theft by neighboring microbes. To this end, microbes which specialize in the metabolism of recalcitrant carbon utilize antimicrobial compounds to prevent their neighbors from stealing these resources. These antimicrobial compounds are also believed to play a significant role in the suppression of soil-inhabiting, plant-pathogenic, organisms. As rising global temperatures are anticipated to increase the relative proportion of recalcitrant carbon within the soil, soil-inhabiting microbes are anticipated to alter their production of and resistance to antimicrobial compounds to further their ability to compete for these complex resources. Through this fellowship, the PI will further our understanding of how the adaptation of microbes to increasingly prominent recalcitrant carbon will influence interactions between soil-inhabiting microbes. The results of this research will be vital in promoting soil health and will ensure the protection of food crops from soil-inhabiting pathogens. Furthermore, this fellowship will further the training of the fellow, research personnel, graduate, and undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota as well as promote the participation and training of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>In this research, isolates of Streptomyces, a genus of prominent, soil-borne, antibiotic-producing bacteria, will undergo long-term selection for growth in petridishes containing a sole carbon source of varying recalcitrance. Isolates will be dotted on plates and grown until they exhibit sporulation. Spores will then be transferred to subsequent plates for a total of fifty generations of selection on either recalcitrant or labile carbon. It is anticipated that growth on recalcitrant carbon sources, in contrast to labile carbon, will impart selection for the utilization of a wider range of carbon sources and will increase the frequency and intensity of constitutive antibiotic production. Following fifty generations of growth, the fellow will characterize changes in isolate nutrient use and inhibitory phenotypes as well as genomic and transcriptional changes associated with carbon metabolism and secondary metabolite production. The results of this project will provide insight into the genomic and transcriptional modifications resulting from selection for growth on carbon sources of varying recalcitrancy. This project will further the fellow’s training in microbial ecology and genomic analysis as well as mentorship and scientific communication. The fellow will also recruit undergraduate researchers to train the next generation of scientists.

To do this, new ways to harvest the properties of these materials should be found. One route is engineering atomic-level defects naturally present in these nanomaterials. While all crystalline nanomaterials have variety of defects in them, some defects are more promising than others. One dimensional defects, often referred to as line defects, are only a-few-atoms-wide and run along the entire crystal. This is an excellent opportunity to engineer them to get the properties wanted. Since they are only a-few-atoms-wide, they are intriguing objects embedded inside the main material, and they can have new and exciting properties that are unique to them. Study of these line defects requires ultra-high-resolution microscopes with features that can probe the properties of these defects. This project employs specialized analytical scanning transmission electron microscopes to study the identities, properties, and origins of these line defects. Combining these observations with theoretical predictions will provide additional flexibility when characterizing the defects. Perovskite oxide thin films have proven to be excellent hosts for such defects. The results will affect not only the science of defects in perovskite crystals, but also affect next-generation nanomaterial engineering by defect engineering. Within the framework of this project, high-school students will visit the University of Minnesota to have interactive tours of the Electron Microscopy Center at the Characterization Facility and see high-resolution electron microscopes in action. This outreach educational activity will be an academic-year-long program. Each year, groups of students and teachers from local high schools will participate in these tours, including schools with a considerable minority student population. Such a real-time dive into the structure of the materials and the operations of advanced electron microscopes should inspire students to pursue technical disciplines in college. It should also help teachers better convey to their students the science behind nanomaterials and microscopes using images obtained during their University of Minnesota visit. <br/>Technical Summary<br/>Advances over the past two decades have shown large numbers of materials can be scientifically exciting and technologically desirable when they have dimensions at the nanometer scale. Discoveries of new phenomena unique to nanoscale materials are being made almost daily, ranging from new physics—such as quantum transport of qubits in semiconductor nanowires or tetradymite chalcogenides being topological insulators—to new applications. Identifying the next frontiers in nanomaterials becomes more-and-more relevant. A new path for exciting new science and next-generation technology is possible through exploring and engineering the naturally-occurring defects in nanoscale materials, especially extended defects. These extended line (or 1D, dislocations and disclination, etc.) and planar (or 2D, grain boundaries, stacking faults, etc.) defects are particularly promising because they run across the entire crystal in one or two directions and are atomically small in other directions. Among them, line defects are only a-few-atoms-wide in two directions and extended in the third direction. With such natural geometry, it is expected that the properties of 1D defects should resemble a chain of atoms or a chain of single-unit cells. These defects should be rich with new physics and new quantum materials’ phenomena not seen in 2D materials. Nanostructures containing them could take advantage of both the features of the defect and the host. The study of new defects – understanding their properties and engineering them into new structures – is the main topic of this project, and it could be what is next in nanomaterials. Determining the effects of key factors (such as composition, strain, and temperature) on formation of line defects and their rearrangements in perovskite oxides are central aims of this work. Perovskite oxides (ABO3), are highly flexible and can accommodate various types of distortions, due to their complex structure. Such structural flexibility allows the perovskite host to accommodate unique extended defects, including those of different compositions. Thus, exploring such non-conventional defects in perovskite oxides has the potential to be extremely fruitful, largely expand the fundamental science of ceramic crystals, and transform next-generation nanomaterials. This study of non-conventional 1D line defects in perovskite oxides will be conducted ex-situ and in-situ using atomic-resolution, analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) aided by density function tehroy (DFT) calculations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While superconducting quantum devices have reached a high level of maturity as a technology, coupling of qubits to one another to enable large-scale circuits for practical computation still remains a challenge. This project seeks to address this challenge by exploring a new approach for coupling superconducting circuits using a thin electromagnetic coupler interposed between qubit layers. The proposed work will be based on an innovative integration of quantum elements that are by themselves well-established in the PI’s and Co-PIs’ labs. Successful performance of the proposed work will expand our knowledge of quantum states in superconducting devices and will result in the development of improved quantum manufacturing approaches of broad interest for practical quantum information processing technologies.

A substantial part of this effort will reach out to school students from the local Native American community. <br/><br/>Developing new approaches to 3D integration of superconducting qubits is of crucial relevance for realizing high-depth circuits suitable for running practically relevant algorithms. Current coupling techniques for transmon qubits typically involve relatively large (millimeter-sized) coplanar resonators, while for phase qubits a variety of different capacitive or inductive coupling approaches are being investigated. No optimal solution has yet been identified for vertical expansion. Existing approaches are typically planar, due in part to limitations stemming from the technology used to create the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs) typically angle-deposition and controlled oxidation of the tunnel barrier. This results in low spatial densities for JJ circuits and coherence-limiting cross-talk. In order to address this challenge, the PIs will fabricate high-quality JJ array chips and link them vertically via waveguide arrays operating in the microwave frequencies. While each enabling component and manufacturing method has been demonstrated, their integration is a daunting task with high-risk and the co-PIs are uniquely positioned to tackle this challenge. Intellectual significance: the team’s vision of full-3D integration of JJs and cross-talk shielding is in its early stages and untested experimentally, yet presents a potentially transformative approach to solve, in a single stroke, the triple challenge of efficient superconducting circuit coupling, high-density 3D vertical integration, and cross-talk mitigation.

It focuses on three select materials families: telluride superconductors, including SnTe and PbTe; superconducting half-Heusler compounds, most importantly YPtBi; and conventional semiconductors, such as Si and Ge. Broadly, the first two groups involve Dirac and topological semimetals and, moreover, tellurides are of technological relevance due to their outstanding thermoelectric properties. In conventional semiconductors, the team is testing a recent prediction of shear-induced metallization and superconductivity. The novel approaches applied to these materials can be expected to transcend the field of superconductivity and become invaluable to future studies of quantum materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mini-school and workshop will take place at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Macaulay2 is a leading computer algebra system for supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. It is open source, and researchers can extend its functionality by contributing their own code in the form of packages. The workshop will be an opportunity for new users to learn from experienced programmers how to develop high quality packages that will be made publicly available to support future research. The first two days, which will be targeted at graduate students and postdocs with limited Macaulay2 experience, will consist of introductory lectures and computational problem sessions to facilitate a smooth onboarding process for less-experienced participants to the projects of the following week. The workshop will also include professional development activities for early career mathematicians, including the opportunity to present on their research, and a panel discussion on jobs.<br/><br/>Workshops that support the intensive development of Macaulay2 packages have an immediate impact on the research programs of both package developers and researchers worldwide. A cursory search for ""Macaulay2"" as a reference in MathSciNet shows 1643 matches, with 123 from the year 2022 alone. This is just one highlight of the importance of computer experimentation to current work in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and adjacent research areas, as well as the role of Macaulay2 in advancing the state of knowledge in these subjects. Maintaining this status requires developing new software packages, enhancing the performance and usability of those that already exist, and training new generations of mathematical scientists. Each component of the mini-school and workshop is designed to meet one or more of these goals.

COP problems have broad applicability across manufacturing optimization, semiconductor wire routing, logistics planning and execution, and financial portfolio management. However, COP problems are notoriously difficult or even impossible to solve via classical computers on a scale suitable for commercial application. Current state-of-the-art COP solvers need tremendous computing power, are unsuitable for edge computing, rely on undeveloped technology, or use similar algorithms to classical computers. The goal of this project is to provide consumers with a drop-in replacement COP solver that is faster, more precise, more mobile, and more energy efficient than state-of-the-art classical computers and COP solvers. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) based parallel combinatorial optimization problem (COP) computing cluster accessible through a cloud interface. The proposed solution will directly solve COP problems, increasing the speed, precision, and power efficiency compared to classical computers or current quantum-based COP solvers. Additionally, the cluster uses all standard semiconductor technology allowing for near-term hardware manufacturing, unlike current quantum computing competitors. The device also works at room temperature, making it the only suitable edge device for directly solving COP problems. A hybrid computing algorithm combining the custom and classical methods will parallelize the COP solving across numerous custom chips. Many custom chips will be combined into a single cluster to maximize the speed and efficiency of the hybrid algorithms. An introductory cloud service interface will be incorporated with the custom computer cluster to facilitate outside access. The end goal of this project is to create a state-of-the-art scalable, accessible, and economical COP solver that overcomes the inherent disadvantages of quantum and classical computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During pregnancy, the uterus remains relaxed while growing and stretching to accommodate the developing fetus. Conversely, the uterus activates at term to produce forceful contractions for delivery, only to return to its original shape to prepare for the next pregnancy. If the uterus contracts too early, the pregnancy can result in preterm birth, which is a leading cause of death in children under five. The understanding of how the uterus remains relaxed, activates, and reverses its adaptations to pregnancy is limited - making it difficult to predict the timing of labor. This project will develop a computer model to identify how changes due to the growing fetus control uterine adaptations and mechanical function during pregnancy. This research will advance the health of pregnant patients and babies by providing an improved understanding of uterine changes during pregnancy. The knowledge gained from this project also has implications for other organs, where deformations of even a fraction of the amount observed in the uterus can lead to mechanical failure. Further, this project will support an educational program to foster engagement of pregnant and parenting high school girls in science and engineering. The research will be incorporated into a hands-on educational module for pregnant and parenting high school girls, who will be hosted for an on-campus college experience. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to uncover the mechanical signals that drive uterine growth, remodeling, and mechanical function during pregnancy. Based on the known mechanoadaptive capabilities of the uterus, the research objectives include 1) experimental quantification of uterine growth and remodeling biomechanics during a normal mouse pregnancy, and 2) building, validating, and testing a growth and remodeling finite element model of uterine mechanobiology. Critical questions to be answered include: A) How do uterine loading, growth, and remodeling interact and influence the mechanical cues that uterine smooth muscle cells experience? B) What mechanical cues control uterine smooth muscle cell growth? and C) Do the mechanobiological mechanisms of normal uterine adaptations apply to abnormal pregnancies? Through these experimental and computational studies, this research will advance the knowledge of uterine biomechanics and mechanobiology. The research is integrated into outreach activities that target pregnant and parenting girls, who are severely underrepresented in science and engineering. Together, this project supports the principal investigator's long-term vision to improve the lives of women through research and to diversify the engineering workforce pursuing careers in women's health research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, when a user visits an online retailer, the products shown are selected by a recommender system designed to help one find things to buy and to increase the vendors sales. Recommender systems are also behind most online news sources, and they can shape which news people see. Given the importance of recommender systems to individual choice, it is critical for researchers to be able to carry out studies to evaluate different designs and their impact on the users of the system. But conducting such studies is beyond the resources of most researchers. To get meaningful results requires building and sustaining a community of willing users who have given their permission to be studied.  As a result, the amount of experimental research – and specifically experimental research on long-term users of a system – has plummeted. Almost all such studies are conducted by commercial recommendation platforms and their results are rarely made known to the public. This project is designed to develop a shared news recommender system specifically to enable researchers nationwide to be able to carry out experiments and learn just how different algorithms and interfaces affect users. This should create the knowledge that will allow the community to fully understand the impact of these systems and design new recommender systems that can enhance fairness and equity. When complete, this research infrastructure will support researchers in answering critical questions about how complex and often opaque recommender systems affect user behavior and to test new systems that can improve these systems and their outcomes.<br/><br/>This community-centered project will design and build an experimental news recommender community infrastructure to support research in personalization and recommender systems, AI and machine learning, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, social computing, and other fields that would benefit from the ability to carry out online field experiments with long-term users of a system.  The cloud-based software infrastructure includes a pluggable recommendation architecture in which researchers can deploy custom algorithms and interfaces, a feed of news articles starting with those obtained through a partnership with the Associated Press, experiment-support modules including consent, payment, and surveying of subjects, and support for two news interfaces—first a news digest and then a progressive web news browser.  The infrastructure will maintain a set of long-term consented users, provide extensive support to researchers including overarching IRB protocols, training, sample experiments, datasets and metrics, and live support through a researcher support team.  It will be governed by a community advisory board drawn from the researcher community with representatives of the content providers and end-users and charged with allocating experiment slots and steering the development and management of the infrastructure.  By developing and deploying this research infrastructure, the investigators seek to empower individuals and small groups to study important questions in recommender systems, including questions about how different algorithms and interfaces can alter the diversity of sources and viewpoints represented and provide users with greater understanding and control over the content they explore.  The investigators come from five institutions spread across the country and will in turn assemble and train a diverse team to take on this technically challenging and important work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical sensemaking in science focuses on students’ ability to blend core disciplinary science ideas with cross-cutting mathematical concepts, such as patterns and proportions, while engaging in scientific practices such as computational thinking, making predictions, and reasoning from evidence.  Current visions for undergraduate STEM education stress the need to integrate i) key disciplinary ideas and ii) crosscutting concepts with iii) authentic scientific practices, resulting in what is called three-dimensional learning. This requires developing new assessments with the ability to detect when students engage in three-dimensional learning and reveal this to instructors. This project seeks to extend previous work to identify opportunities to observe mathematical sensemaking in science in the classroom.  The project plans to develop open-ended questions to explore undergraduate mathematical sensemaking in science using three dimensional learning assessments. This serves the goal of improving STEM education at the undergraduate level by providing engaging and authentic assessments capable of revealing student thinking. Findings from this project should help inform teaching practice in undergraduate STEM courses and help students foster computational thinking skills. <br/><br/>The project will target two aims. Aim 1 is to apply an evidence-centered design process to develop open-ended assessment items that elicit mathematical sensemaking in science (MaSS) and align with a three-dimensional learning (3DL) assessment framework. The evidence-centered design approach for the assessments will provide an opportunity to collect validity evidence throughout the process and allow development of similar items across disciplines. Assessment tasks and coding rubrics will be based on frameworks for 3DL and MaSS, and will be iteratively revised to elicit and categorize student MaSS. The project will conduct interviews with undergraduates to examine their MaSS while completing the assessment items, and with college faculty to ensure alignment with disciplinary topics and phenomena common in college courses. Aim 2 is to administer constructed response items across undergraduate science disciplines to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS across biology, chemistry, and physics. The project will administer the assessment items from Aim 1 at a diverse set of undergraduate institutions to collect student responses. These responses will be used to establish evidence of the validity, reliability, and fairness of the items quantitatively. Further, the responses will be used to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS in varied science disciplines. The project meets the need for developing rich, formative assessment items for undergraduate 3DL that reveal student thinking, which is essential for instruction aimed to foster MaSS. The project will also advance understanding of how undergraduates integrate thinking about key STEM concepts and mathematics across disciplines by following a 3DL assessment framework. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is expected to modernize the tools used today by private and public laboratories to collect and purify pathogens, particularly human coronaviruses from community wastewater, for testing and diagnostic purposes. The new technological tools are expected to simplify the workflow, reduce costs and time, and enable the prediction of pandemics several weeks before observing clinical cases. Such early prediction would provide the public and government agencies with important data and sufficient time to take preventive measures. The technological products of this project are expected to empower the growing number of companies and laboratories offering wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) services and help establish WBE as a routine, cost-effective and reliable tool for public health monitoring.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a major technological barrier for the detection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Commercially available nucleic acid collection and purification kits are designed for clinical samples with small volumes.  These kits are not generally used for large wastewater volumes where the virus is present at low concentrations. As a result, current processes are time-consuming, and result in the recovery of less than 30% of viruses and nucleic acids, significantly reducing the sensitivity. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel virus and nucleic acid collection and purification technology from wastewater. Specifically, the project tasks aim at enhancing understanding of virus properties, particularly human coronaviruses in wastewater and their interactions with filter media. The project’s innovative approach is to design a streamlined workflow that includes all the steps from sample collection to detection, in a single disposable cartridge containing novel filters with high affinity to viruses. This development is expected to enhance viral and nucleic acid recovery in wastewater to over 90%, while reducing costs. The developed tools will be independently tested and evaluated by third-party laboratories to confirm their performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis of the potassium (K) isotopes in silicate rocks has been closely linked to understanding past silicate weathering rates. However, recent research suggests that formation of new silicate clay minerals from the byproducts of silicate weathering may reverse the chemical reactions of silicate weathering thus making the processes less effective in cooling the planet. The formation of clays from byproducts, a process termed “reverse weathering”, is challenging to study as it occurs in remote sectors of the deep ocean and the reaction rates are slow. Thus, this presents a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the long-term silicate and carbon cycles impacting what we know about past, present, and future climate. This project develops stable potassium isotopes as a novel proxy, or tracer, to help quantify modern and past silicate weathering rates. Via analyzing potassium isotopes in Earth materials, this project investigates the modern and past potassium cycle and its relationship to silicate weathering and the global carbon cycle. The study will quantify changes in marine potassium isotopes, helping to provide robust estimates on the global significance of marine clay formation and its impact on climate. Through a comprehensive plan integrating research and education, this project (1) supports geochemistry infrastructure to fulfill research and education missions of the university; (2) provides laboratory training for undergraduate and graduate students along with educational opportunities for primary and secondary students; (3) extends accessibility of a modern geochemical laboratory beyond the campus boundary to attract and build the workforce in geochemistry-related fields; and (4) raises public awareness of the societal relevance of geochemistry research and of our planet.<br/><br/>The research aims to advance understanding of the marine stable potassium (K) isotopic cycle to develop a robust proxy for silicate weathering. This project applies controlled laboratory experiments and analysis of purposefully selected natural marine samples to constrain key uncertainties in the modern marine potassium isotopic cycle, including potassium isotope fractionation during seawater–basalt alterations and clay formation. Isotope mass balance models are being applied to quantitatively estimate the global significance of present-day clay formation or reverse weathering. Additionally, laboratory experiments, supplemented by spectroscopic characterization and a modeling approach, will advance knowledge on potassium isotope exchange kinetics and fractionation pertinent to derivation of seawater potassium isotope compositions from relevant geologic archives such as marine evaporites. Deliverables include development of an interpretative framework that will enable the use of geological archives to reconstruct potassium isotope signatures in ancient oceans and to assess their implications to the long-term carbon cycle. Through the integration of research and education, this project advances interdisciplinary research in potassium isotopes and expands application of the developing tool to the complex plant–soil–climate feedbacks in the context of changing climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past two decades, the United States drug shortages have become an unwelcome reality with public health and national security implications. In a recent survey of 719 health system pharmacists, all reported experiencing drug shortages in the preceding year with 52% of the shortages involving LVPS. The main mitigation strategy, reported by 81% of the respondents, was the hoarding of available supply. Current strategies to mitigate drug shortages are mostly focused on reaction and recovery rather than preparedness. There is a critical need for an alternative pharmaceutical supply for LVPS that ensures long-term resilience.

The result of this capability and its subsequent commercialization will positively affect the outcomes of medical procedures for millions of patients worldwide. The system will enable tracking medical instruments over the full procedure space, improving accuracy and reliability, and reducing patients and staff exposure to harmful radiation while being compatible with the intraoperative imaging. The device will allow for the creation and augmentation of navigation volumes on demand during procedures as well as reliable detection and mitigation of electromagnetic interference. The broader societal impacts of the technology offer a flexible and highly customizable platform across key industry sectors important to the United States competitiveness including biomedical, consumer, industry, and defense. <br/><br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of a new electromagnetic navigation system that requires the solution of several complex problems involving mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering. Millions of minimally invasive medical procedures are performed annually worldwide which include cardiac ablations, valve replacements, bronchoscopies, orthopedic procedures, cancer treatments, etc., all with increasing robot utilization. Electromagnetic navigation systems are widely used in these procedures providing knowledge of locations and orientations when medical instruments are out of the “line of sight”. Currently available systems, mostly developed before the wide adoption of robotic surgeries, can handle only fixed navigation volumes and are often unable to track instruments throughout the full procedure space, which may require the use of additional harmful X-ray radiation. Current tools use bulky field generators incompatible with imaging equipment and provide only limited detection and correction of electromagnetic interference-induced location distortion. This project will address these shortcomings. The electromagnetic navigation system which will have robust detection and mitigation of various electromagnetic interferences, will enable procedure-time adjustable navigation volumes, will allow high location sampling rates with multiple sensors, and will be compatible with intraoperative fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) imaging, allowing for key differentiating features required for commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2316451,Experimental Study of Clinopyroxene Growth and Sector Zoning,EAR,Petrology and Geochemistry,12/01/2022,02/03/2023,Benoit Welsch,MN,Macalester College,Standard Grant,Jennifer Wade,06/30/2024,"$46,799.00",,bwelsch@macalester.edu,1600 GRAND AVE,SAINT PAUL,MN,551051899,6516966062,GEO,157300,9150,$0.00,"Clinopyroxene is a major rock-forming mineral on Earth and other rocky planets, and one of the first solids crystallized by high temperature magmas and lavas. In theory, the chemical composition and the crystal shape of clinopyroxene can be used to extract information about the liquid from which the mineral formed (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition). When studying rock samples, the accuracy of such markers is critical in deciphering the dynamics of a large number of volcanic and magmatic systems, both on Earth and other planetary bodies. However, the crystallization processes of clinopyroxene are complex and still poorly understood, which hampers its potential as a tracer of magmas. The proposed work aims to refine the crystallization processes of clinopyroxene using a combination of laboratory experiments and advanced analytical methods. These results will complete previous datasets, provide new insights on the mineral at the microscopic scale, and pave the way for new research avenues. The tasks will nurture a collaboration between three academic institutes with premier experimental petrology laboratories (Brown University, the University of Hawaii, and the Universite de Lorraine), support the professional development of two early-career researchers, and provide a research opportunity for three undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Clinopyroxene is one of the most complex igneous minerals in terms of its variability in texture and chemical zoning. Even today, its intricate complexity stands as a significant roadblock to reconstructing the history of clinopyroxene-bearing magmas. The rationale for this project stems from former characterizations of natural samples bearing complex sector zoning, and previous experiments on clinopyroxene + melt systems. This new work will exploit a trio of experimental apparatuses to address a broad range of crystallization conditions: heating stage microscope, 1-atm gas mixing furnace, and piston cylinder. The investigations will focus on major- and trace-element composition (in fine-scale detail to capture intricate zoning), growth features (habits, melt and solid inclusions, crystal defects) and the crystallization kinetics of clinopyroxene during the cooling of synthetic and natural melts. The experimental products will be analyzed using optical, electron probe, and transmission electron microscopies, and laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry. The overarching goals are: to document the textural variation of clinopyroxene at various pressure, temperature, and cooling conditions; to establish the conditions (cooling rate, undercooling, melt composition) at which sector zoning occurs; and to examine major- and trace-element partitioning between clinopyroxene and melt, and between sectors in clinopyroxene. These goals are intended to advance the practical application of clinopyroxene thermobarometry, by establishing which sectors and elements faithfully record magmatic pressure-temperature conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
